The class is on death. My name is Shelly Kagan. The very first thing I want to do is to invite you to call me Shelly. That is, if we meet on the street, you come talk to me during office hours, you ask some question; Shelly's the name that I respond to. I will, eventually, respond to Professor Kagan, but the synapses take a bit longer for that. It's not the name I immediately recognize. I have found that over the years, fewer and fewer students feel comfortable calling me Shelly. When I was young, it seemed to work. Now I'm gray and august. But if you're comfortable with it, it's the name that I prefer to be called by.Now, as I say, this is a class on death. But it's a philosophy class, and what that means is that the set of topics that we're going to be talking about in this class are not identical to the topics that other classes on death might try to cover. So the first thing I want to do is say something about the things we won't be talking about that you might reasonably expect or hope that a class on death would talk about, so that if this is not the class you were looking for, you still have time to go check out some other class.So here are some things that a class on death could cover that we won't talk about. What I primarily have in mind are sort of psychological and sociological questions about the nature of death, or the phenomenon of death. So, a class on death might well have a discussion of the process of dying and coming to reconcile yourself with the fact that you're going to die. Some of you may know about Elisabeth K√ºbler-Ross' discussion of the so-called five stages of dying. There's denial, and then there's anger, and then there's bargaining. I actually don't remember the five stages. We're not going to talk about that. Similarly, we're not going to talk about the funeral industry in America and how it rips off people, which it does, in their moments of grief and weakness and overcharges them for the various things that it offers. We're not going to talk about that. We're not going to talk about the process of grieving or bereavement. We're not going to talk about sociological attitudes that we have towards the dying in our culture and how we tend to try to keep the dying hidden from the rest of us. These are all perfectly important topics, but they're not, as I say, topics that we're going to be talking about in this class.So what will we talk about? Well, the things we'll talk about are philosophical questions that arise as we begin to think about the nature of death. Like this. In broad scope, the first half of the class is going to be metaphysics, for those of you who are familiar with the philosophical piece of jargon. And roughly, the second half of the class is going to be value theory.So, the first half of the class is going to be concerned with questions about the nature of death. What happens when we die? Indeed, to get at that question, the first thing we're going to have to think about is what are we? What kind of an entity is a person? In particular, do we have souls, and for this class when I talk about a soul, what I'm going to mean is sort of a bit of philosophical jargon. I'm going to mean something immaterial, something distinct from our bodies. Do we have immaterial souls, something that might survive the death of our body? And if not, what does that imply about the nature of death? What kind of an event is death? What is it for me to survive? What would it mean for me to survive my death? What does it mean for me to survive tonight? That is, you know, somebody's going to be here lecturing to the class on Thursday, presumably that will be me. What is it for that person who's there on Thursday to be the same person as the person who's sitting here lecturing to you today? These are questions about the nature of personal identity. Pretty clearly, to think about death and continued existence and survival, we have to get clear about the nature of personal identity. These sorts of questions will occupy us for roughly the first half of the semester.And then we'll turn to value questions. If death is the end, is death bad? Now, of course, most of us are immediately and strongly inclined to think that death is bad. But there are a set of philosophical puzzles about how death could be bad. To sort of give you a quick taste, if after my death I won't exist, how could anything be bad for me? How could anything be bad for something that doesn't exist? So how could death be bad? So it's not that the result is going to be that I'm going to try to convince you that death isn't bad, but it takes actually a little bit of work to pin down precisely what is it about death that's bad and how can it be death? Is there more than one thing about death that makes it bad? We'll turn to questions like that. If death is bad, then one might wonder would immortality be a good thing? That's a question that we'll think about. Or, more generally, we'll worry about how should the fact that I'm going to die affect the way I live? What should my attitude be towards my mortality? Should I be afraid of death, for example? Should I despair at the fact that I'm going to die?Finally, we'll turn to questions about suicide. Many of us think that given the valuable and precious thing that life is, suicide makes no sense. You're throwing away the only life you're ever going to have. And so we'll end the semester by thinking about questions along the lines of the rationality and morality of suicide. So roughly speaking, that's where we're going. First half of the class, metaphysics; second half of the class, value theory.Next thing I need to explain is this. There's, roughly speaking, two ways to do a class, especially an introductory class like this. In approach number one, you simply lay out the various positions, pro and con, and the professor strives to remain neutral; sort of not tip his hand about what he holds. That's approach number one. And sometimes in my intro classes that's the approach that I take. But the other approach, and the one that I should warn you I'm going to take this semester, in this class, is rather different. There's a line that I'm going to be developing, pushing, if you will, or defending in this class. That is to say, there's a certain set of views I hold about the issues that we'll be discussing. And what I'm going to try to do in this class is argue for those views. Try to convince you that those views are correct.To help you know sort of ahead of time quickly what those views are, I want to start by describing a set of views that many of you probably believe. So I'm going to give you a cluster of views. Logically speaking, you could believe some of these things and not all of them. But here's a set of views that many of you probably believe, and I imagine most of you believe at least some of these things.So here's the set of common views. First of all, that we have a soul. That is to say we are not just bodies. We're not just lumps of bone and flesh. But there's a part of us, perhaps the essential part of us, that is something more than the physical, the spiritual, immaterial part of us, which as I say in this class we'll call a soul. Most of us, most of you, probably believe in souls. Certainly most people in America believe in some sort of immaterial soul. And given this existence of this immaterial soul, it's a possibility, indeed a fair likelihood, that we will survive our deaths. The death will be the destruction of my body, but my soul is immaterial and so my soul can continue to exist after my death. And whether or not you actually believe in a soul, you hope that there's a soul so that there'll be this serious possibility of surviving your death because death is not only bad, but so horrible that what we would like to have happen is, we would like to live forever. And so, armed with a soul, as it were, there's at least the possibility of immortality. Immortality would be wonderful. That's what we hope is the case, whether or not we know that it's the case. Immortality would be wonderful. That's why death's so bad. It robs us of immortality. And if there is no soul, if death is the end, if there is no immortality, this is such an overwhelmingly bad thing that the only, the obvious reaction, the natural reaction, the universal reaction, is to face the prospect of death with fear and despair. And as I mentioned earlier then, death is so horrible and life is so wonderful that it could never make sense to throw it away. So suicide is both immoral on the one hand and never makes sense. It's always irrational as well, in addition.That, as I say, is I think a common set of views about the nature of death. And what I'm going to be doing, what I'm going to be arguing in this class, is that that set of views is pretty much mistaken from beginning to end. And so I'm going to try to convince you that there is no soul. Immortality would not be a good thing. Fear of death isn't actually an appropriate response to death. Suicide, under certain circumstances, might be rationally and morally justified. As I say, the common picture is pretty much mistaken from start to end. That's at least my goal. That's my aim. That's what I'm going to be doing. Now, since of course, I believe the views I believe--and I hope at the end of the semester you'll agree with me, because I think they're true and I hope you'll end up believing the truth [laughter]. But I should say that the crucial point isn't for you to agree with me. The crucial point is for you to think for yourself. And so what I'm really doing is inviting you to take a good, cold, hard look at death, and to face it and think about it in a way that most of us don't do. If you, at the end of the semester, haven't agreed with me about this particular claim or that particular claim, so be it. I'll be content--I won't be completely content--but I'll be at least largely content as long as you've really thought through the arguments on each side of these various issues.Karen, maybe this would be a good time for you to pass around the syllabus.Next introductory remark: A lot of today's talk is going to be devoted to business. I'll get to, if time permits, some philosophy at the end. I want to make one more remark about what I'll be doing in terms of this class. This class, as I say, is a philosophy class. We'll basically be sitting here thinking about what we can know or make sense of with regard to death using our reasoning capacity. We'll be trying to think about death from a rational standpoint.One kind of evidence or one kind of argument that we won't be making use of here is appeal to religious authority. So some of you may believe in, for example, the existence of an afterlife. You may believe you're going to survive your death. You may believe in immortality because that's what your church teaches you. And that's fine. It's not my purpose or intention here to try to argue you out of your religious beliefs or to argue against your religious beliefs. All I'm going to ask is that we not appeal to such religious arguments, appeal to revelation or the authority of the Bible, or what have you, in the course of this argument. In the course of this class.If you want to, you could think of this class as one big hypothetical. What conclusions would we come to about the nature of death if we had to think about it from a secular perspective? Making use of only our own reasoning, as opposed to whatever answers we might be given by divine revealed authority. Those of you who believe in divine revealed authority, that's a debate for another day. It's not a debate that we're going to be engaged in here in this semester. Similarly, although I'm not going to ask you in your discussion sections to hide your religious views, you'll be asked in the course of defending them, to give reasons that would make sense to all of us.That's by way of sort of where the class is going. Let me now turn to some discussion about the requirements of the class, grades and so forth and so on. The syllabus is going around the class. Almost all of you have it at this point. The syllabus doesn't really say a whole lot. I've already given you an overview of what topics we'll be going to. The crucial point about the syllabus is that it indicates what reading you need to have done for any given week. Now, I've done my best to peg the readings to where I will be on that week's lecture, but I don't lecture with lecture notes, for the most part. Sometimes I take a little bit longer than I anticipated. Actually, I often take a little bit longer than I anticipated. No doubt at some point I'll fall behind. At some point I may rush to catch up ahead. It won't always be the case that the readings will exactly coincide with where the lectures are at. Nonetheless, in any given week, for the start of that week, you should have done the readings that are listed for that week. The readings on the syllabus simply say the author, and there are a couple of books that are available at the bookstore. There are a larger packet of readings that's available as a course pack at Tyco's [local print shop]. And so for any given week you can find the reading. One or two cases, maybe just one actually, where I've got more than one article by the given author, I've given the title of the article as well. It shouldn't be difficult to locate the reading for any given week.The format of the class, of course, is a familiar and straightforward one. I'll be sitting here lecturing twice a week, this time, 10:30 to 11:20. Once a week you will break up into discussion sections. The discussion sections will meet for 50 minutes. Each one of you will have a single time. But it'll be different times the discussion sections meet. For the first time, the philosophy department has just switched over to the online discussion section registration system. I'm not 100% certain how that works. I've not used it before. I take it the idea is something like this. Right now, if you were to shop the class, you could find the tentative list of discussion section days and times. So be sure to find some time that works for you. You can't actually register for any of those discussion section times yet. But as of, I think, next week when you're able to begin your online registration, you will be able to register for any discussion section that still has a slot, still has a space open in it. In fact, you won't be able to finalize your registration for your courses until you've actually signed up for an available slot. Once you have registered, if some other slots become available that weren't previously available, I gather you'll be sent some sort of email by the system, in case some other time would be better for you. You can put yourself on waiting lists and so forth. It sounds pretty good on paper. Maybe it'll all work smoothly. I've never been through it before. I hope we won't have any problems. Right now what you want to make sure is that there is a time that's available--right now all the times are available--but that there is a time that works for you. Because if you can't find a discussion section that works for you, you won't be able to take this course. Any questions about that?I should actually ask, any questions about anything that I've asked or said so far, up to this point? Let me make a remark about questions, which is--today's mostly business. Hopefully, it'll be fairly straightforward. But both today and throughout the entire semester, as I'm lecturing I want to invite you to jump in with questions. Well, jump in is a bit of an exaggeration. I don't want you to just start talking, but raise your hand. If I'm saying something that you don't understand, the chances are pretty good that there's 25 or 50 other students in the class who don't understand it either. I'm just not being clear. So I want to welcome you, I really want to invite you, whenever you've got some reactions to the things that I'm saying, raise your hand, I'll call on you. Say, \"Shelly, I didn't really understand what you were saying about the soul. Could you please explain that again?\" Or, for that matter, if you've got some quick reactions or thoughts or responses to the arguments that I'm laying out and you want to share them with the class as a whole, then very much I want to invite you to do this. Now this class is too big for us to have some close, intimate conversation between the 150-180, however many students there are here. That's not going to happen. But the chance for detailed discussion in the discussion section, that's where that should happen. But still, there is the chance for brief reactions and definitely a chance for questions. I very much want to invite you to do that. So, if at any point you've got something you want to ask about or some two bits you want to add, raise your hand, wiggle it around, make sure I see you. I may want to finish the particular point that I'm making, but I'll try to come back to you and I'll then raise your question. And if I remember at least, I will repeat the question out loud so that everybody can hear it.I also want to say that I will try to have the practice of, after class ends, if you want to continue the discussion, you have some questions that occurred to you towards the end, we didn't have a chance to share them with the class as a whole, I will, on a normal day, meet outside and continue to talk with however many of you want to do that until you're done. I just love talking about this stuff and I welcome you to come to my office hours. I invite you to ask questions in class or, if you prefer, after class as well. Again, any questions about any of that? Yeah.Student: [inaudible]Professor Shelly Kagan: When are my office hours? That's a great question and I don't know the answer to it. I haven't planned them yet. On Thursday, start the class by asking me that and I'll give you an answer. All right.Other bits of business. I should say something about grades. Now many of you may have heard, many of you may know, and if you don't already know this, I should warn you, that I have a reputation around Yale as being a harsh grader. I know this is true, that is, I know I have the reputation, both because I periodically in my student evaluations get told I'm one of Yale's harsher graders, and because every now and then the Yale Daily News will have an article about grade inflation and they'll always ask me, \"Well Professor Kagan is somebody...\" Once there was a story on grade inflation that the Yale Daily News began by saying, \"As Shelly Kagan (known at Yale as one of the hardest graders).\" So I know I've got at least the reputation of being a hard grader. I don't actually know whether it's deserved or not, because Yale does not publish information about what the grading averages are. At other schools I've taught at there's been information along the lines of well the typical grade in an introductory course in the humanities is such and such. Shortly after I came here to Yale, and I started realizing that people thought I was a harder grader than most other Yale professors, I called the administration and asked, \"Do you have this sort of information?\" The answer is \"Yes.\" \"Will you give it to me?\" The answer was \"No.\" They don't share this information with the Yale faculty. Seems odd. The explanation, of course, actually isn't that hard to come by. The worry is that those of us who are harder graders than average, if the information were published, would feel guilty and sort of ease up on our grading. But those who are easier graders than average will never feel guilty and toughen up. So the result would be a constant push up with the grades. At any rate, I don't know for certainty that I'm a harder grader, but I believe that it's the case based on reactions I get when I give the speech that I'm about to give.Okay, so [laughter]. When I open the blue book, the Yale guideline, the Yale catalog, it's got a page, as you all know, where it says what letter grades mean at Yale. I didn't actually bring it this year. Sometimes I do, but I've got it pretty much memorized. It says, for example, next to each letter grade what it means. B, for example, means good. A means excellent, C means satisfactory, D is passing, F is failing. B, let's start with B. B means good. Now the crucial question then is what does good mean? I take good to mean good. Consequently, [laughter] if you were to write a good paper for me, that would get a B. And when you get a B from me--now, I say me, this is the royal me. Because I won't actually be grading your papers. Your papers will be graded by a small army of TAs. But they will grade under my supervision, and in keeping with the standards that I ask them to grade with. So when you're pissed off about your grade, the person to take it up with--well, take it up with them. But eventually you'll want to take it up with me. So when you get a B from us, B doesn't mean what a piece of crap. B means good job! And so you should be pleased to get a B, because it meant you were doing good work and it's not easy to do good work in philosophy.A means excellent. Now excellent does not mean publishable. Excellent does not mean you are God's gift to philosophy [laughter]. So it's crucial to understand it doesn't mean that the only way you're going to get an A is to be God's gift to philosophy. A means excellent work for a first class in philosophy. This is an introductory class. It does not presuppose any background in philosophy. Still, to get an A, you've got to show some flair for the subject. You've got to show not only have you understood the ideas that have been put forward in the readings and in the lectures and so forth, but you see how to sort of put them together in the paper in a way that shows you've got some aptitude here. You did it in a way that made us take note. That's what we try to reserve As for. Some of you will end up getting As, if not at the beginning, by the end of the semester. Many of you will end up getting Bs, if not at the beginning, by the end of the semester. Many of you will not start out doing good work. Many of you will start out doing satisfactory work or, truth be told, less than satisfactory work.Now look, I was an undergraduate once. And I know what it is to write a typical undergraduate paper. You sit down the night before and you had a couple of ideas. You thought about it maybe for a half an hour. And you meant to get to it sooner, but you had a lot of other things to do. And you throw it off in a couple of hours and maybe stay up late. You know it's not the worst thing you ever wrote, and it's not the best thing you ever wrote, and it has a couple of nice ideas, but maybe it could be better. It's sort of a satisfactory job. Yale says satisfactory means C. So many of you will start off the semester writing that kind of paper.And the fact of the matter is, some of you will start off writing worse papers than that. Because writing a philosophy paper is a difficult thing to learn how to do. It's exercising a set of muscles that a lot of you have not spent a lot of time exercising. Now it's not as though you haven't spent any time doing it. You've had bull sessions, right, with your high school friends or in your college dorm or what have you. But you haven't done it with the kind of discipline and rigor that we're looking for here. So, like anything else, it's a skill that gets better with practice. And what that means, of course, is you won't do as well at the beginning as you're likely to be doing toward the end. Some of you, unfortunately, won't do very good jobs at the beginning--and my TAs, I'll encourage them to be prepared to give Ds. If the vices of the paper significantly outweigh the virtues, that's a D. If the vices very significantly outweigh whatever virtues there are, that's some kind of an F. So the fact of the matter is many of you in your initial papers will get lower grades than you've probably ever gotten before in your life. I wanted to warn you about that.Now I say this not so much to depress the hell out of you, but (a) partly to warn you, and (b) to make it clear that I believe that it's a skill. Writing a good philosophy paper is a skill and you can get better at it. Consequently, most of you will get better at it. So let me make the following remark. Officially, each paper--you have three five-page papers. Each paper is worth 25% of your grade, officially. But--the remaining 25% is discussion section; I'll get to that in a minute--officially, 25% of your grade is for each of the three papers. But if, over the course of the semester, you get better, then we will give, at the end of the semester, when we're figuring out your semester grade, we'll give the later, stronger papers more than their official weight. For many of you, the first paper will be clearly the worst paper you write. And then we'll just throw that grade away; give greater weight to the second and third papers. If the third paper is the strongest, we will give even more weight to the third paper. There's no formula here, a great deal depends on the overall pattern, what your TA tells me about how you've done over the course of the semester. But this policy of giving greater weight, if you show improvement, is something that most of you will benefit from. So if you end up not doing well, the moral of the story is not to go running off and dropping the class, but to figure out what you did right, what you didn't do right, how to make the second paper better and the third paper stronger, again. And if you do show improvement, that will very significantly influence and emerge in terms of the impact it has on your overall semester grade. Because of this policy, I don't actually know when all is said and done whether at the end of the semester I'm any harder, whether I depart from the average or not.Let me quickly mention there's a fairly typical grade distribution for the overall grades of this, at the end of the semester. Roughly 25% of you are likely to end up with some kind of an A at the end of the semester. Fifty, 55% of you or so are likely to end up with some kind of a B. Twenty, 25% percent of you might end up with some sort of a C. Sometimes there's a couple of percent that end up worse than that. Unsurprisingly, you've got the ability to do decent work in this class and most of you have the ability to do good work, and some of you have, a fair chunk of you have, the ability to do excellent work, though it may take some work on your part to get to that point.The last thing I should say about the grades is why do I do this? It's really I try to do it as a sign of respect for you. I know that may seem like a surprising thing to say when I've just sort of gone on my little gleeful amount about how I'm going to fail all of you [laughter], but it's worth my saying you guys are so smart. You're so talented. You've gotten so far on your ability that many of you have learned to coast. It's not doing you any kind of service to let you continue coasting. My goal here is to be honest with you, right? Look, you're smart enough probably most of you to pull off some sort of B without breaking into a sweat, or at least not a significant sweat. So be it. But it's just lying to you to pretend that that's excellence in philosophy. So what I want to do in this class is be honest with you and tell you, \"You've really done work here to be extraordinarily proud of yourself\" versus \"Yeah, you've done something okay\" or \"You've done good work. Admittedly, it's not great, but you've done good work.\" All right, that's 75% of your grade is the papers.The remaining 25% of your grade is based on discussion section. Now that's a lot of your grade to turn on discussion section. So the first thing I need to tell you is I really mean it. If you blow off discussion section, you're grade will suffer. So it's worth knowing in a general way what you need to do to earn a good grade in discussion section and here the answer is, perhaps the obvious one, you need to participate. You need to come to discussion sections having thought about the lectures, having done the readings, having thought about the questions that they raise, and you need to come to discussion section then prepared to discuss this week's set of issues. You need to listen to what your classmates are saying and say why you disagree with them. And not just that you disagree with them, but to raise an objection. Or why you agree with them. And when somebody else then attacks them, say, \"Look, I think that what John was saying was a good point and here's how I think he should have defended his position,\" or what have you. You need to engage in philosophical discussion. If you're not participating in discussion section, you're not doing what the section is there for.Philosophers love to talk and we love to argue. The way to get better at thinking about philosophy is by talking about philosophy. So I'm putting my money where my mouth is. I'm saying, \"Look, yeah, that's an important part of the class. So important that it's going to be worth 25% of your grade.\" Again, it doesn't mean--this is slightly different from the papers--that you've got to be brilliant philosophically to get an A. Rather, you've got to be a wonderful class citizen to get an A for discussion section. So, as I put it, in fact I think I put it this way on the syllabus, participation--and here I mean respectful participation, not hogging the limelight--participation can improve your grade, but it won't lower your grade. Nonparticipation, or not being there, that will lower your participation grade. Any question about any of that?All right. So I'm sorry to have sort of the long gloom and doom, but it seems that it's only fair to let you know what you're getting into. One other remark about the discussion sections. The way I think of it is like the conversation hour for your foreign language class. How many of you have had a philosophy class before? Thanks. Maybe 15% of you. Maybe 20% of you. Most of you have not. That's pretty normal. Don't go into discussion section thinking, \"Oh, I can't talk. I don't have any background in philosophy. I've never done this sort of thing before.\" That's true for most of you. The way you get better is by talking philosophy.All right. Next remark. I guess this is sort of just one last connection with regard to grades. This is an intro philosophy class. The crucial point about intro is it means first class in philosophy. It doesn't presuppose any background in philosophy. It doesn't necessarily mean easy. Some of this material for some of you is going to be very, very difficult. And although the number of pages that you'll have to read are not--there's not a lot. Probably in a typical week, 50 pages, maybe less. For many of you, you're going to find it dense material. And although I don't really have the fantasy that many of you will read this stuff twice, if you had the time to do it, that would be a wonderful thing to do. Philosophy is hard stuff to read.Other remark about this being an intro class is that it's introductory in that the issues that we're talking about are kind of first run through. Every single thing that we discuss here could be pursued at greater depth. So, for example, we'll spend whatever it is, maybe a week and a half talking about the nature of personal identity, two weeks. But one could easily spend an entire semester thinking about that question alone. So don't come away thinking that whatever it is that we've talked about here in lecture is the last word on the subject. Rather, it's something more like first words.Actually, one other word about the readings and the lectures. With one exception, I won't be spending very much time talking about the readings. The exception is Plato, where I'll lecture, maybe two lectures, trying to reconstruct Plato's central arguments, at least the arguments relevant to our class. We'll be reading one of Plato's dialogues. But for the most part, although I'll occasionally, periodically refer to the readings, I won't spend a lot of time talking about the views in the readings. The readings you should think of as complementary to my lectures. The idea is that there's more to say than what I've said. And you'll find some more of what there is to say in the readings. Or there may be positions that I mention, but I don't develop, because I'm not perhaps sympathetic to them, and you might find somebody who is sympathetic to them, developing them in the readings. The readings are a crucial component of the class. You won't get everything you need simply by coming to the lectures. But equally the case, that the views that I'll be developing in the lectures are, although not necessarily unique to me, aren't all laid out in the readings. You won't get everything I'm talking about in the lectures, if all you do is the readings. They're both parts of the class.All right. I want to end by--I'm not close to ending, but the last thing I'm going to do is read aloud some student evaluations. I have found over the years that some students like me; some students don't like me. I don't know how to make this point any clearer than to share with you a sampling of the student evaluations. These are not actually from last spring, but they're typical enough that I was too lazy to make some new quotes. Quote one. These are actual quotes from former actual students.(1) \"The lectures were clear and followed a very logical order.\"\n(2) \"I thought the class was not always organized.\"\n(3) \"I thought it was a very well organized class.\"\n(4) \"Overall, I was unsatisfied with this course. Few substantive conclusions were reached.\"\n(5) Along the same vein, \"I think he should avoid saying at the end of each segment of the class, ‚ÄòUltimately, you'll have to decide what to think for yourself.'\" [laughter] I should end the class by saying, \"You will believe.\" Actually, I started the class by saying that. You will believe what I believe.\n(6) \"It might be improved by presenting other views better and more objectively, since Kagan always ended a particular line of reasoning by defeating the argument if he didn't agree with it. He could be a bit more unbiased and tolerant of other perspectives.\"\n(7) \"Lectures were sometimes repetitive or obvious, but occasionally, they provided new insights.\"\n(8) \"I know that some felt the pace of the arguments was a little slow, but I felt that this was generally necessary, not only for the unphilosophy-savvy population, but also to cover all points.\"\n(9) \"Extremely thorough and thoughtful. Receptive to questions.

Here's what I'm doing. Thirteen: \"He would work through arguments right in front of us, which then helped me work through them on my own.\"\n(14) \"Shelly is an incredibly dynamic lecturer.\"\n(15) \"He's just in his own world babbling on and on [laughter]. I'd zone out with regularity.\"\n(16) \"I have to say that Shelly Kagan is probably the best lecturer I had in my four years at Yale.\"\n(17) \"He's the type of teacher you either love or hate.\" Now that's pretty clearly true.I wish there were some easy litmus test that I could just give you so you'd know which of you would be making a mistake taking this class. I don't know how to give it to you.Next topic, grades.\n(1) \"He tried to intimidate us too much with his promise of impossible grading so that everyone took the class credit/D/fail, when we all probably ended up with As or Bs. His grading was not hard.\"\n(2) \"I recommend it, but only credit/D/fail. Professor Kagan is harsh with grading.\"\n(3) \"When Shelly says he's the harshest grader on campus, he isn't lying.

If you put in the effort, the grade will reflect that.\" So that settles the question am I a harsh grader or not.The last question for the evaluation is should you take the class or not? Would you recommend it to somebody else?\n(1) \"I believe this class is one of the most mind-opening experiences of my life.\"\n(2) \"No. It's a waste of a course.\" [laughter]\n(3) \"It gets kind of depressing at times, but I suppose that's due to the nature of the subject [laughter].\"\n(4) \"This course stands out as one of the more unique and stimulating courses I've taken at Yale.\"\n(5) \"Excellent class.

The class just seemed to be a platform for Kagan to throw out random ideas and the students were never required to engage in any thought.\"Well, that clears that up. Let me end with a couple of other quick remarks. One--these are some of my all-time favorites from previous years.(1) \"Not doing the reading didn't hurt me at all.\" Now, these are anonymous comments. I don't know who wrote this comment. But I do know this. Whoever wrote this remark is an idiot [laughter]. Whoever wrote this remark seems to be under the impression that the point of being at Yale is to spend $40,000 a year of your parents' money and get away with learning as little as possible. Well, for those of you who want to try it, you probably could pass this class and maybe even get an okay grade without doing the readings. There's no final exam. But still, it's crucial to understand, doing the readings is an important part of learning what this course has to offer. Different quote. \"Kagan is a self-righteous little man\" [laughter]\" Now I've got to tell you, that bit about being little, that really hurts. Another one. \"Great course. Wonderful professor. Fascinating subjects. The deepest thinking I've done in my life.\" Final quote. \"This class taught me how to think more than any other at Yale.\"I don't know whether I pull it off. Pretty obviously, for a number of students, I don't manage to pull it off, but that's at least what my aim is. I'm trying to help you think. I welcome you and I hope you'll be back on Thursday.[end of transcript]"},"lct02.html":{"url":"lct02.html","title":"Lecture 2","keywords":"","body":"Death: Lecture 2 TranscriptJanuary 18, 2007    Professor Shelly Kagan: The first question we want to discuss has to do with the possibility of my surviving my death. Is there life after death? Is there a possibility that I might still exist or survive after my death? Now at first glance--and in fact, I think, at second glance it's going to turn out to be true--you might think that the answer to this question would depend on two basic issues. Do I survive my death? Do we survive our deaths? You think, the first thing we have to get clear on is well what am I? What kind of a thing am I? Or generalizing, what kind of thing is a person? What are we made of? What are our parts? It seems plausible to think that before we could answer the question, \"Do I survive?\" we need to know how I'm built. And so the first thing we're going to spend a fair bit of time on is trying to get clear on what's a person? What are the fundamental building blocks of a person? The second question that you might think we'd want to get clear on is, \"What's the idea, or what's the concept, of surviving?\" Before we ask, \"Do I survive?\" we need to get clear on \"What am I?\" and \"What is it to survive?\" What is it for something that exists in the future to be me?Now this question can be discussed philosophically in quite general terms. What's the nature of persistence of identity over time? But since we're especially interested in beings like us, people, this topic, this sub-specialized version of the question of identity, gets discussed under the rubric of the topic, personal identity. What's the key or the nature or the basis of personal identity? As we might put it: What is it for somebody who's here next week to be the same person as me? What's the nature of personal identity? So, as I say, at first glance you might think to get clear on the answer, \"Do I or might I or could I survive my death?\" we need to know, what am I? What's a person? What's the metaphysical composition of people, on the one hand? And we need to get clear on the nature of identity or persistence or, more specifically, personal identity. Now as I say, I believe that when push comes to shove, we do need to get clear about both of those questions and so that's going to take the first several weeks of the class. We're going to spend a couple of weeks talking about, \"What's a person?\" And then we're going to spend several weeks, or at least a week or so, talking about the nature of personal identity.But before we can even get started, there's a question, really an objection to the whole enterprise. So we're about to spend a lot of time asking the philosophical question: Is there life after death? Could there be life after death? Might I survive my death? But there's a philosophical objection to the entire question. And the objection is fairly simple. It says the whole question is misconceived. It's based on a confusion. Once we see the confusion, we can see what the answer to our question is. Could I survive my death? The answer has got to be--this is what the objection says--the answer has got to be, obviously not. All right, so here's the objection.I should mention that the very first reading that you're going to be doing is a couple of pages from Jay Rosenberg, a contemporary philosopher. He gives us a version of this objection. So I'll give you one version. You'll have another version in your readings. The objection basically says: What does it mean to say that somebody's died? We're asking, \"Is there life after death?\" What does it mean to say that somebody has died? Well a natural definition of death might be something like the end of life. So then, if that's right, then to ask, \"Is there life after death?\" is just asking, \"Is there life after the end of life?\" The answer to that ought to be pretty obvious. Well, obviously, the answer to that is no. After all, if we're saying once you've run out of life, is there any more life? Well, duh! That's like asking, when I've eaten up all the food on my plate, is there any food left on my plate? Or what happens in the movie after the movie ends? These are stupid questions, because once you understand what they're asking, the answer is just built in. It follows trivially.So although it has seemed to people over the ages that the question, \"Is there life after death?\" is one of the great mysteries, one of the great philosophical things to ponder, the objection says that's a kind of illusion. In fact, once you think about it, and not all that long, you can see the answer's got to be no. There couldn't possibly be life after death. There couldn't possibly be life after the end of life.Or suppose we ask the question in a slightly different way. Might I survive my death? Well what does the word \"survive\" mean? Well, survive is something like we say that somebody's a survivor if something's happened and they haven't died. They're still alive. When there's a car accident, you ask, so-and-so died, so-and-so survived. This person survived. To say that they survived is just saying that they're still alive. So, \"Might I survive my death?\" is like asking, \"Might I still be alive after\"--well what's death? Death is the end of life. So-- \"might I still be alive after I've stopped living? Might I be one of the people who didn't die when I died?\" Gosh, the answer to that is, again, duh! No. You couldn't possibly survive your death, given the very definition.It should remind us of--at least it reminds me of this joke that you probably told. It seemed hysterical when you were seven. The plane crashes exactly on the border of Canada and the United States. Exactly on the border. There's dead people everywhere. Where do they bury the survivors? The answer is: You don't bury the survivors. So when you're seven you think, \"I don't know. Do they bury them in Canada? Do they bury them in America?\" The answer is: You don't bury the survivors, because survivors are people that haven't yet died. So, \"Can I survive my death?\" is like asking, \"Could I not have yet died after‚Ä¶?\" The answer is, of course, you have to have died if you died and you haven't survived if you've died. So the question can't even get off the ground. That, at least, is how the objection goes.Now I don't mean to be utterly dismissive of the objection. That's why I spent a couple of minutes trying to spell it out. But I think there's a way to respond to it. We just have to get clearer about what precisely the question is that we're trying to ask. This is something that Rosenberg tries to get clear on as well. So here's my attempt to make the question both a bit more precise, and a question that's an open question. A question we can legitimately raise.Well, now as you will hear on several occasions over the course of the semester, I'm a philosopher. What that means is I don't really know a whole lot of facts. So I'm about to tell you a story where I wish I knew the facts. I don't know the facts. If I could really do it right, I'd now open the door and bring in our guest physiologist, who would then provide the facts that I'm--what I'm about to go is \"blah, blah, blah.\" But we have the physiologist come in and he'd actually tell us these things. I don't know them. I don't have that person.But take a look at what happens when a body dies. Now, no doubt, you can kill people in a lot of different ways. You can poison them, you can strangle them, you can shoot them in the heart. The causal paths that result in death may start different, but I presume that they converge and you end up having a set of events take place. Now what are those events? This is exactly where I don't really know the details, but I take it it's something like: because of whatever the original input was, eventually the blood's no longer circulating and oxygen isn't making its way around the body. So the brain becomes oxygen-starved. Because of the lack of oxygen getting to the cells, the cells are no longer able to carry on their various metabolic processes. Because of this, they can't repair the various kinds of damage they need, or create the amino acids and proteins they need. So as decay begins to set in and the cell structures begin to break down, they don't get repaired as they would normally do, and so eventually have breakdown of the crucial cell structure and boom, the body's dead. Now as I say, I don't really know whether that's accurate, the little rough story I just told, but some story like that is probably right.And in typical philosophical fashion, I've drawn that story for you up here on the board. [See Figure 2.1.] So the events that I don't really know the details of, we can just call B1, B2, B3, up through Bn. Before B1 begins, you've got the body working, functioning, in its bodily way--respirating, reproducing the cells, and so forth and so on. And at the end of the process, by Bn, the body's dead. B for bodily. B1 through Bn; that's what death is. At least, that's what death of the body is. As I say, it's the sort of thing that somebody from the medical school or a biologist or a physiologist or something could describe for us.So here's the question then. Suppose we call that process \"death of the body.\" Call what has occurred by the end of that sequence of events, \"bodily death.\" Now here's a question that we can still ask, at least it looks as though we can still ask it. Might I, or do I, still exist after the death of my body? Might I still exist after bodily death? I don't mean to suggest in any way that we yet know the answer to that question, but at least that's a question that it seems as though we can coherently raise. There's no obvious contradiction in asking: Might I still exist after the death of my body? The answer could turn out to be no. But at least it's not obviously no. If the answer turns out to be no, it's going to take some sustained argument to settle it one way or the other. The answer could turn out to be yes, for all we know at this point. This just brings us back to the thought that whether or not I could still exist after the death of my body looks like it should depend on what I am. So in a minute, that's the question that I'm going to turn to.But it's a bit cumbersome to constantly be asking: Might I still exist after the death of my body? So no harm is done, once we've clarified the question that we're trying to ask, if we summarize that question in a bit of a jargon or slogan. We say, instead of asking: Might I survive? Or: Might I continue to exist after the death of my body? --you might put it this way. You might say for short: Will I survive the death of my body? No harm done. Or: Will I survive my death? Because what we were just stipulating we mean when we talk about my death in the context of this question is the death of my body. No harm done. We can just say for short: Will I survive my death or might I survive my death? For that matter, no serious harm done if we ask: Is there life after death? As long as we understand that what we're not asking about there is life of my body. Just another familiar way of trying to ask: Will I still be around after my death? Will I still exist after my death? So I think there's a perfectly legitimate question and that's the question we now want to turn to.As I said, it looks as though to answer the question, \"Could I continue to exist after the death of my body?\"--\"Is there life after death?\" \"Could I survive my death?\" for short--to answer that question, we need to get clearer about: What exactly is it for something to be me? That's a question we'll turn to in a couple of weeks. First, we've got to get clearer about: What am I? What kind of an entity am I? What am I made of? In philosophical jargon, this is a question from metaphysics. So we're asking the metaphysical question: What kind of a thing is a person? It seems plausible to think that whether or not a person can survive or continue to exist after the death of his or her body should depend on how he's built, what he's made of, what his or her parts are.So, let me sketch for you two basic positions on this question. What is a person? Two basic positions. They're both, I imagine, fairly familiar. What we're going to have to do is try to decide between them. They're not the only possible positions on the question of the metaphysics of the person. But they're, I think, the two most prominent positions and definitely the ones most worth taking seriously for our purposes.So, first possible position is this. A person is a combination of a body and something else--a mind. But the crucial thing about this first view that we want to talk about is that the mind is thought of as something separate from, and distinct from, the body. To use a common enough word, it's a soul. So people are, or people have, or people consist of, bodies and souls. The soul is something, as I say, distinct from the body. I take it the idea of the body is a familiar one. It's this lump of flesh and bone and muscle that's sitting here in front of you and that each one of you sort of drags around with you. It's the sort of thing that we can put on a scale and prod with a stick and the biologists can study, presumably made up of various kinds of molecules, atoms and so forth. So we've got the body. But on this first view, we also have something that's not body. Something that's not a material object. Something that's not composed of molecules and atoms. It's a soul. It's the house of, or the seat of, or the basis of, consciousness and thinking, perhaps personality. But the crucial point for this view is that the proper metaphysical understanding of the mind is to think of it in nonphysical terms, nonmaterial terms.That, as I say, is the first basic view. I'm going to say more about that view, a fair bit more about that view, over the next couple of weeks. First, let me sketch the other basic view. So this first view we can call \"the dualist view.\" Dualist, of course, because there's two basic components--the body and the soul. Although I may occasionally slip, I'm going to try to preserve the word \"soul.\" When I use the word \"soul,\" I'm going to have in mind this dualist view according to which the soul is something immaterial, nonphysical. Some other kind--the body is a material substance. The soul is an immaterial substance. That's the dualist view.The alternative view that we're going to consider is not dualist, but monist. It says there's one basic kind of thing and only one basic kind of thing. There are bodies. So what's a person? A person is just a certain kind of material object. A person is just a body. Of course, it's a very fancy material object. It's a very amazing material object. That's what this second view says. The person is a body that can do things that most other material objects can't do. So on the monist view--which we'll call \"physicalism,\" because it says that what people just are, are these physical objects--on the physicalist view, a person is just a body that can‚Ä¶now you fill in the blank. You point out the kinds of things that we can do. We can talk. We can think. We can sing. We can write poetry. We can fall in love. We can be afraid. We can make plans. We can discover things about the universe. According to the physicalist view, a person is just a body that can do all of those things: can reflect, can be rational, can communicate, can make plans, can fall in love, can write poetry. That's the physicalist view.As I say, we've got two basic positions. There's the dualist view--people are bodies and souls. And there's the physicalist view, according to which there are no souls. There are no immaterial objects like that. There are only bodies, though when you've got a functioning body like ours, so the physicalist says, these bodies can do some pretty amazing things. The kind of things that we all know people can do. Two basic views.From a logical point of view, I suppose you might have a third possible view. If we've got the monist who says there's bodies but there's no souls, you could imagine somebody who says there are souls but there are no bodies. This would roughly be a view according to which there are minds, but there aren't really physical objects. Physical objects are a kind of illusion, perhaps, that we fall into. Or thinking about them in materialistic terms might be greatly confused or mistaken. This view is sometimes known in philosophy as idealism: all that exists, are minds and their ideas. Physical objects is just a way of talking about the ideas the mind has or something like that. Idealism is a position that's got a very long history in philosophy and for many classes would be worth taking a fair bit of time to consider more carefully. But for our purposes, I think it's not a contender. So I'm just going to put it aside. The positions that I'm going to--and there are other possibilities as well. There are views where mind and body are just two different ways of looking at the same underlying reality where the underlying reality is neither physical nor mental. That view's also worth taking seriously in a metaphysics class, but for our purposes, I mention it and put it aside. The two views we are going to focus on are, on the one hand, the dualist view--people have souls as well as bodies--and the physicalist view--all we have, all we are, are bodies.Let me say something more then about the dualist position. According to the dualist, the mind is this immaterial substance and we could call it by different names. No harm would be done if we call it a mind, though the reason I will typically talk about a soul is to try to flag the crucial point of the dualist view. The mind is based in, or just is something nonphysical, something nonmaterial‚Ä¶The soul can direct and give orders to the body, on the one hand. On the other hand, the body generates input that eventually gets sensed or felt by the soul. You take a pin and you stick it through my flesh of my body and I feel pain in my soul, in my mind. So, two-way interaction. As always with philosophy, there's more complicated versions of dualism where maybe the interaction doesn't work both ways, but let's just limit ourselves to good, old-fashioned, two-way interactionist dualism. So my mind controls my body. My body can affect my mind in various ways. But for all that, they're separate things.Still there's this very tight connection. We sometimes put it: the soul is in the body, though talking about spatial locations here may be somewhat metaphorically intended. It's not as though we think that if you start opening up the body you'd finally find the particular spot. Here's the place where the soul is located. Though it does seem, from this dualist perspective, as though souls are located, I'm sort of viewing the world from here. Just like each of you is viewing the world from a particular location. So maybe your soul is located, more or less, in the vicinity of your body. Crucial point, of course, the attraction of the dualist view, from our point of view, is that if there's a soul as well as the body, and the soul is something immaterial, then when the body dies, when we have B1 through Bn and the death of the body occurs. So at the end of Bn, the body stops repairing itself. Decay sets in. We all know the sad story. The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out. At the end of the day--well it maybe it takes longer than a day--the body has decomposed. Yes, all that bespeaks the end of the body. But if the soul is something immaterial, then that could continue to exist, even after the destruction of the body. That's the attraction, at least one of the attractions, of the dualist view. The belief in the soul gives you something to continue to exist after the end of your body. So what's death? Well, if normally there's this super tight connection between my soul and my body, death might be the severing of that connection. So the body breaks and no longer is able to give input up to the soul. The soul is no longer able to control the body and make it move around. But for all that, the soul might continue to exist. And so at least the possibility that I'll survive my death is one worth taking very, very seriously if we are dualists.A couple of things to point out about this view. One is I've been talking as though a person is a combination, kind of a soul and body sandwich. So a person has two basic building blocks. The bodily part and the soul part. It's natural to talk that way, but if we want belief in the soul to help us hold out the possibility at least that there might be life after death, then I think we need to actually say that strictly speaking, it's not that a person is a soul plus a body. Strictly speaking, I think we need to say the person just is the soul. After all, if the person is the combination, if the person is the pair, soul plus the body, destroy the body, you've destroyed the pair. If the person is the pair and the pair no longer exists, the person no longer exists. So if we want belief in a soul to help us leave open the door to the possibility that I survive the destruction of my body, it had better not be that the body is an essential part of me. It's simpler, more straightforward to say instead, \"What I am strictly speaking is a soul.\" As long as the soul exists, I exist. Of course, my soul, me, I, have a very tight connection to a particular body. But still, you could, in principle, destroy the body without destroying me. Look, I have a particularly close connection to the house I live in. But for all that, you can destroy my house without destroying me. So that's I think the position that we ought to ascribe to the dualist. The person is, strictly speaking, the soul. The soul has a very intimate connection with the body, but the person is not the soul and the body. The person is just the soul. So even if that intimate connection gets destroyed, the person, the soul, could continue to exist.The second point to clear up is that there's really three different issues that might interest us. One, metaphysically, are bodies and souls distinct? Is the mind to be understood in terms of this immaterial object, the soul? So are there two kinds of things? That's the first question. Are souls and bodies distinct? Second question, though, is: Does the soul, even if it exists, survive the destruction of the body? It could be something separate without surviving. That's why I've tried to say if there are souls, at least that opens the door to the possibility that we will survive our death. But, it doesn't guarantee it, because absent further argumentation, there's no guarantee that the soul survives the death of the body. Even if it's separate, it could be that it gets killed at the very same time or destroyed at the very same time that the body's being destroyed. Maybe when these physical processes, B1 through Bn, take place, they set into motion--remember, after all we're interactionist dualists. There's this very tight causal connection between the body and the mind and the soul and the body, the body and the soul. Just like when you prick my body, that bodily process sets up certain things taking place in my soul. Maybe when B1 through Bn take place, they set up some other processes in my soul. Call them S1 through Sn. And maybe S1 through Sn results in the destruction of my soul. So simultaneously with my body dying, my soul dies.Okay, this one's going to be a little bit trickier to draw. The first part, S1..., that's easy. Sn. The question is: How do I draw the soul? I don't really know [draws a smiley face on the board connected to a halo. See Figure 2.2]. So the mere fact that we decide, if we do ultimately decide that there is a soul, something nonphysical, separate and distinct from the body, doesn't guarantee that we survive our physical death. That's going to be a separate question we'll have to turn to. The first question's going to be: Are there any souls? Next question is going to have to be: If there are, do we have any good reason to think that they survive the death of the body? Third question that might interest us, that does interest us, is this: If it survives, how long does it survive? Does the soul continue to exist after the death of the body? Does it continue to exist forever? Are we immortal? Most of us would like that to be true. We want there to be souls so that we can be immortal. And so the question's got to be not only, is the soul distinct? Does it survive the death of my body? But does it continue to exist forever? Those questions--hang on one second--are ones that especially interest Plato. So in about a week or so we'll start reading Plato's Phaedo. The purpose of that dialogue, of that philosophical work, is to argue for the immortality of the soul. That's a question we'll be turning to. Yeah?Student: [inaudible]Professor Shelly Kagan: Great. So the question is this. If the very idea of soul that we're working with here under the dualist picture is the soul as an immaterial substance, it's not made of ordinary atomic matter. If the soul is immaterial, doesn't it follow automatically, trivially, that the soul can't be destroyed by a material process? After all, there was death of the body, B1 through Bn. That's a material process, a physical process. Doesn't it follow that a soul, an immaterial entity, can't be destroyed by a material, physical process? That's a great question. What I want to say is, the short answer for now is, I don't think it follows automatically. It doesn't follow trivially. It may follow. Plato's actually going to give us some arguments for pretty much that same claim. Plato's going to argue once we understand the sort of metaphysical nature of the soul, we'll see why it couldn't be destroyed. That's going to take some fancy arguments. The reason I think it doesn't follow trivially is because, remember, I said we're dealing with interactionist dualism. We've already admitted that bodies are able to affect the soul, right? The body is having all sorts of light bounce off my eyes of various wavelengths. And because of that my soul is having various visual sensations about the number of people in front of me, colors, and so forth and so on. I gave the example of pricking my body. That's a physical process that causes some sorts of changes in the mental processes occurring in my soul. Once we've admitted that on this kind of dualist picture the material body can influence what happens in the immaterial soul, then it doesn't seem that we have any grounds for shutting the door to the possibility that the right physical process, B1 through Bn, might set up this horrible mental, soul process, S1 through Sn, resulting in the destruction of the soul. It's a possibility. It's going to take more arguments to rule it out. Yeah?Student: [inaudible]Professor Shelly Kagan: Yeah, another great question. The question was: I said it seems plausible to say my soul is located, more or less, here because I seem to view the world from here. But maybe that's not right. Maybe we shouldn't talk about the location of the soul at all. After all, if the soul is an immaterial object, can immaterial objects have locations? I don't know. The short answer is I don't know. I know very little about how immaterial objects are supposed to work. So although I'm trying to sketch the dualist position, as I explained on Tuesday, I don't myself believe in souls. I don't actually think that the dualist view is correct. You might say, I'll leave that problem--are souls spatially located or not--to be worked out by those who believe in it. For our purposes, I think it doesn't really matter. If you want to say souls have a location, where are they located? They're located more or less where my body is. At least, as long as my body's working. Maybe at death the soul gets liberated from the body and is able to wander more freely. Sometimes people talk about, in fact we'll be reading about this, out-of-body experiences. And so maybe during those unusual times the soul wanders from the body and comes back to it. Or, alternatively, maybe the soul doesn't have any location at all. Maybe that's just an illusion created by the fact that I'm getting this visual input from my body. My body certainly has a location. Maybe the right way--imagine somebody who was in a room with remote control television setup and so forth and so on. And he's seeing what's happening in Chicago, even though he's sitting in a room in New Haven. Well, you could understand why he might fall into the trap of thinking of himself as located in Chicago with all the visual inputs coming from Chicago. So maybe that's how it works with the soul. We get lulled into thinking that we are where our bodies are. But that's really a metaphysical illusion. I don't really know. For our purposes, I think it's not crucial. Though it's a great question, but I'm not going to try to pursue it any further.All right. So one question: Is there a soul? Second question: Does it survive the death of our body? Third question: If it does, does it live forever? Does it continue to exist forever? Is the soul immortal? We will initially think about the first question: Do we have any good reason to believe in souls at all? And only after a while will we turn to the second and third question: Does it survive and, more particularly, is it immortal? That's the first basic view about the nature of a person. A person has a soul, something immaterial and not a body. I take it that the view is a familiar one. Many of you probably believe in it. Those of you who don't believe in it have probably, at least, been tempted to believe in it. I'm sure you all do know people who believe in it. It's a very familiar picture. But, of course, the question we're going to have to ask ourselves is: Is it right? Is there reasons to believe it's correct?Turn now to the second basic view, the physicalist view, according to which a person is just a body. This is a materialist view. People are just material objects, the sorts of things biologists poke and prod and study. It's important--I think this is the crucial point--that when we say a person is just a body, we don't understand that to mean--the physicalist doesn't mean that as--a person is just any old body. It's not as though there aren't important differences between different physical objects. Some physical objects can do things of a far more interesting sort than other physical objects.Here's a piece of chalk. It's a physical object. It's just a body. What can it do? Well, not a whole lot. I can write on the board with it. I can break it in two. You let go of it, it drops down. Not a very interesting physical body. Here's a cell phone. It's just a body. It's not the most interesting physical object in the world, but it's a whole lot more interesting than a piece of chalk. It can do all sorts of things a piece of chalk can't do. If the physicalist is right, then here's another physical object for you--me, Shelly Kagan. I'm a pretty impressive physical object. Now arrogant as I may be, I don't mean to suggest I'm any more impressive than you guys are. Each one of us, according to the physicalist, is just a body that can do some amazing things. We are bodies that can think. We are bodies that can plan. We are bodies that can reason. We are bodies that can feel. We are bodies that can be afraid and be creative and have dreams and aspirations. We are bodies that can communicate with each other. We are bodies that are--well, here's a word for it: We're bodies that are people. But on the physicalist view, a person is just a body. And that's where we'll take it up next time.[end of transcript]"},"lct03.html":{"url":"lct03.html","title":"Lecture 3","keywords":"","body":"Death: Lecture 3 TranscriptJanuary 23, 2007    Professor Shelly Kagan: Today we're going to take up the discussion where we left it last time. We were talking about two main positions with regard to the question, \"What is a person?\"On the one hand, we have the dualist view; that's the view that we spent a fair bit of time sketching last meeting. The dualist view, according to which a person is a body and a soul. Or perhaps, strictly speaking, what we should say is the only part that's essential to the person is the soul, though it's got a rather intimate connection to a particular body. That's the dualist view. In contrast to that, we've got the physicalist view, according to which there are just bodies. A person is just a body, as we might put it. Now, the crucial point here, the point I was turning to as we ended last time, is that although a person on the physicalist view is just a body, a person isn't just any old body. A person is a body that has a certain set of abilities, can do a certain array of activities. People are bodies that can think, that can communicate, that are rational, that can plan, that can feel things, that can be creative, and so forth and so on.Now, we might argue about what's the exact best list of those abilities. For our purposes, I think that won't be crucial, and so I'll sometimes talk about this set of abilities without actually having a canonical list. Just think of them as the set of abilities that people have, the things that we can do that other physical objects--chalk, radios, cars--those things can't do. Call those the abilities that make something a person. To just introduce a piece of jargon, we could call those the P abilities, P for person. Or we could talk about the various kinds of ways--this is the physicalist way of thinking about it--according to the physicalist, a person is just a body that has the ability to fulfill the various P functions. And we can talk, then, about a person as a P-functioning body. Or we could say that a person is a body that is P-functioning.It's important to see that the idea is, although it's a body, it's not just any old body. Indeed, it's not just any old human body. After all, if you rip out your gun, shoot me in the heart, I bleed to death, we still have a human body in front of us. But we don't have a P-functioning body. We don't have a body that's able to think, a body that's able to plan, to communicate, to be creative, to have goals. So the crucial thing about having a person is having a P-functioning body.Now, what's a mind on this view? On the physicalist view, it's still perfectly legitimate to talk about minds. The point, though, is that from the physicalist perspective, the best thing to say is, talk about a mind is a way of talking about these various mental abilities of the body. We nominalize it. We talk about it using a noun, the mind. But talk of the mind is just a way of talking about these abilities that the body has when it's functioning properly.This is similar, let's say, to talking about a smile. We believe that there are smiles. Physicalists don't deny that there are minds. Just like we don't deny, we all believe, that there are smiles. But what is a smile? Well, a smile is just a way of talking about the ability of the body to do something. This characteristic thing we do with our lips exposing our teeth and so forth. It's a smile, a rather dorky smile, but there's a smile. Now, if you were listing the parts of the body, you would list the teeth, you would list the lips, you would list the gums, you would list the tongue, but you wouldn't list the smile. So, should we conclude, as dualists, that smiles are these extra nonphysical things that have a special intimate relationship with bodies? Well, you could imagine a view like that, but it would be rather a silly view.Talk about a smile is just a way of talking about the body's ability to smile. There's no extra part. Even though we have a noun, the smile, that if you're not careful might lull you into thinking there must be a thing, the smile. And then you'd have all these metaphysical conundrums. Where is the smile located? It seems to be in the vicinity of the mouth. But the smile isn't the lips. The smile isn't the teeth. So it must be something nonphysical. No, that would just be a silly way to think about smiles. Talk of smiles is just a way of talking about the ability of the body to smile, to form a smile. That's an ability that we have, our bodies have.Similarly, then, according to the physicalist, talk of the mind, despite the fact that we have a noun there, is just a way of talking about the abilities of the body to do various things. The mind is just a way of talking about the fact that our body can think, can communicate, can plan, can deliberate, can be creative, can write poetry, can fall in love. Talk of all of those things is what we mean by the mind, but there's no extra thing, the mind, above and beyond the body. That's the physicalist view.So it's important, in particular, to understand that from the physicalist's point of view, the mind is not the brain. You might think, \"Look, according to physicalists minds are just brains.\" And that wouldn't be a horrendously misleading thing to say, because according to the best science that we've got, the brain is the part of the body that is the seat or house or the underlying mechanical structure that gives us these various abilities. These P functions are functions that we have by virtue of our brain. So that might tempt you into saying the mind on the physicalist view is just a brain.But we probably shouldn't say that. After all, if you shoot me, there's my corpse lying on the stage. Well, there's my brain. My brain is still there in my head. But we no longer have a person. The person has died. The person, it seems, no longer exists. Whether strictly that's the best thing to say or not is a question we'll have to come to in a couple of weeks. But it seems pretty clear that the mind has been destroyed, even though the brain is still there. So I think, at least when there's the need to be careful--maybe we don't normally have a need to be careful--but when there's the need to be careful, we should say, talk of the mind is a way of talking about the P-functioning of the body. Our best science suggests that a well-functioning body can perform these things, can think and plan and fall in love by virtue of the fact that the brain is functioning properly. That's the physicalist view.On the dualist view, what was death? Death is presumably the separation of the mind and the body, perhaps the permanent separation, with the destruction of the body. What's death on the physicalist view? Well, there is no extra entity, the soul. The mind is just the proper P-functioning of the body. So, the mind gets destroyed when the ability of the body to function in that way has been destroyed. Death is, roughly, the end of this set of functioning. Again, this probably should be cleaned up and in a couple of weeks we'll spend a day or half period trying, to clean it up and make it somewhat more precise. But there's nothing mysterious about death from the physicalist point of view, at least about the basic idea of what's going on in death.I've got a stereo. Suppose I hold up my boombox for you and it's playing music. It's one of the things it can do. And I drop in on the ground, smashing it. Well, it no longer can function properly. It's broken. There's no mystery why it can't function once it's broken. Death is basically just the breaking down of the body, on the physicalist point of view, so that it no longer functions properly.One other point worth emphasizing and sketching the physicalist view is this. So, as I said, physicalists don't deny that there are minds. Even though we say \"we're just bodies,\" that doesn't mean that we're just any old body. It's not as though the physicalist view is, \"we're bodies that have some illusion of thinking.\" No, we're bodies that really do think. So there really are minds. We could, on the physicalist point of view, call those souls. Just like there's no danger in talking of the mind from the physicalist perspective, there wouldn't be any serious danger in talking about a soul. And so, in certain contexts, I'm perfectly comfortable--in my physicalist moods, I am perfectly comfortable--talking about this person's soul. He's got a good soul, a bad soul, how the soul soars when I read Shakespeare, or what have you.There's nothing upsetting or improper about the language of the soul, even on the physicalist point of view. But in this class, just to try to keep us from getting confused, as I indicated before and I want to remind you, I'm going to save the word \"soul\"; I'm going to at least try to save the word \"soul\" for when I'm talking about the dualist view. So we might put it this way. The neutral term is going to be \"mind.\" We all agree that people have minds, sort of the house or the seat of our personalities. The question is, \"What is a mind?\" The dualist position is that the mind is a soul and the soul is an immaterial object. So when I use the word \"soul,\" I will try to reserve it for the metaphysical view, according to which souls are something immaterial. In contrast to that, we've got the physicalist view. Physicalists also believe in minds. But minds are just a way of talking about the abilities of the body. So physicalists do not believe in any immaterial object above and beyond the body that's part of a person. Just to keep things clear, I will say that physicalists, materialists, do not believe in souls. Because, for the purposes of this class, I'm going to reserve the word \"soul\" for the immaterialist conception of the mind. In other contexts--no harm in talking about souls.So these are the two basic positions: the dualist view on the one hand, the physicalist view on the other. The question we need to turn to--I take it that just as the dualist view is a familiar one, so it's true that the physicalist view is a familiar one. Whether or not you believe it, you are familiar with the fact that some people believe it, or at least you wonder whether it's true. Does science require that we believe in the physicalist view or not?The question we want to turn to, then, is, \"Which of these two views should we believe: the dualist position or the physicalist position?\" And the crucial question, presumably, is, \"Should we believe in the existence of a soul?\" Both sides believe in bodies. As I say, the dualist position, as we're understanding it, is not a view that says there are only minds, there are no bodies. Dualists believe that there are bodies. They believe that there are souls as well as bodies. Physicalists believe there are bodies but no souls. So there's an agreement that there are bodies. Here is one. Each one of you is sort of dragging one around with you. There's agreement that there's bodies. The question is, \"Are there anything beyond bodies?\" Is there anything beyond the body? Is there a soul? Are there souls? That's the question that's going to concern us for a couple of weeks.If we ask ourselves, \"What reasons do we have to believe in a soul?\" we might start by asking, what reasons do we have to believe in anything? How do we prove the existence of things? For lots of familiar everyday objects, the answer is fairly straightforward. We prove their existence by using our five senses. We just see them. How do I know that there are chairs? Well, there are some chairs in front of me. Open my eyes, I see them. How do I know that there is a lectern? Well, I see it. I can touch it. I feel it. How do I know that there are trees? I see them. How do I know that there are birds? I see them. I hear them. How do I know that there are apples? I see them. I taste them. So forth and so on.That approach pretty clearly isn't going to work for souls, because a soul--and again, we've got in mind this metaphysical view, according to which its something immaterial--isn't something we see. It's not something we taste or touch or smell or hear. We don't directly observe souls with our five senses.You might wonder, well, don't I sort of directly observe it in myself that I have a soul? Although I guess there have been people who've made that sort of claim, it seems false to me. I can only ask each of you to sort of introspect for a second. Turn your mind's eye inward and ask. Do you see a soul inside you? I don't think so. I see things outside me. I feel certain sensations in my body, but it doesn't seem as though I observe a soul. Even if I believe in a soul, I don't see it.How do we prove the existence of things we can't see or hear or taste and so forth? The usual method, maybe not the only method, but the usual method is something like this. Sometimes, we posit the existence of something that we can't see so as to explain something else that we all agree takes place. Why do I believe in the existence of atoms? I don't see individual atoms. Why do I believe in the existence of atoms so small that I can't see them? Because atomic theory explains things. When I posit the existence of atoms with certain structures and certain sort of ways of interacting and combining and building up, when I posit atoms, suddenly I can explain all sorts of things about the physical world. So, I infer the existence of atoms based on the fact that doing that allows me to explain things that need explaining. This is a kind of argument that we use all the time. How do I posit--why do I believe in x-rays, even though I don't see them? Because doing that allows me to explain certain things. Why do I believe in certain planets too far away to be observed directly through a telescope? Because positing them allows you explain things about the rotation of the star or the gravitational fluctuations, what have you. We make inferences to the existence of things we can't see, when doing that helps us to explain something we can't otherwise explain. This pattern of argument, which is ubiquitous, is called \"inference to the best explanation.\"I want to emphasize this bit about \"best explanation.\" What we're justified in believing are those things that we need, not simply when they would offer us some kind of explanation, but when they offer us the best explanation that we can think of. So look, why am I justified in believing in germs, various kinds of viruses that I can't see, or bacteria or what have you, that I can't see? Because doing that allows me to explain why people get sick. But there's other things that would allow me to explain that as well. How about demons? I could believe in demons and say, \"Why does a person get sick and die? Well, it is demonic possession.\" Why aren't I justified in believing in the existence of demons? It's a possible explanation. But what we seem to be justified in believing is not just any old explanation, but the \"best explanation.\" So we've got two rival explanations. We've got, roughly, germ theory and we've got demon theory. We have to ask ourselves, \"Which of these does a better job of explaining the facts about disease?\" Who gets what kinds of diseases? How diseases spread, how they can be treated or cured, when they kill somebody.The fact of the matter is, demon theory doesn't do a very good job of explaining disease, while germ theory does do a good job. It's the better explanation. So we're justified in believing in germs, but not demons. It's a matter of inference, not just to any old explanation, but inference to the best explanation. All right, so, what we need to ask ourselves, then, is, \"What about the soul?\" We can't observe souls. But here's a possible way of arguing for them. Are there things that need to be explained that we could explain if we posited the existence of a soul, an immaterial object, above and beyond the body? Are there things that the existence of a soul could explain and explain better than the explanation that we would have if we had to limit ourselves to bodies? You might put it this way as sort of the easiest version of this kind of argument, for our purposes. Are there things about us that the physicalist cannot explain? Are there mysteries or puzzles about people that the physicalist just draws a blank, but if we become dualists, we can explain these features?Suppose there was a feature like that, feature F. Then we'd say, \"Look, although we can't see the soul, we have reason to believe in the soul, because positing the existence of a soul helps us to explain the existence of feature F, which we all agree we've got.\" Suppose it was true that you couldn't explain love from the physicalist perspective. But we all know that people do fall in love, but souls would allow us to explain that. Boom, we'd have an argument for the existence of a soul. It would be an example of \"inference to the best explanation.\" Now, the crucial question, of course, is, \"What's the relevant feature F?\" Is there some feature that the physicalist can't explain and so we need to appeal to something extra-physical to explain it? Or the physicalist can only do a rotten job of explaining, like demon theory did? And then, if we were to appeal to something nonphysical, we would do a better job of explaining. If we could find the right F, and make out the argument, the physicalist can't explain it or does a bad job of explaining it and the dualist does a better job of explaining it, we'd have reason to believe in the soul. Like all arguments in philosophy, it would be a tentative argument. We'd sort of have some reason to believe in the soul until we sort of see what next argument comes down the road. But at least it would give us some reason to believe in the soul.What I want to do is ask, \"What might feature F be?\" Is there any such feature F? It's probably also worth underlining the fact that what I've really been doing is running through a series of arguments. \"Inference to the best explanation\" is not a single argument for the soul. It's rather the name for a kind of argument. Depending on what F you fill in the blank with, what pet feature or fact you're trying to explain by appeal to the soul, you get a different argument. So let's ask ourselves, \"Are there things that we need to appeal to the soul in order to explain these things about us?\" Here's a first try.Actually, let me start by saying I'm going to distinguish two broad families of characteristics we might appeal to. We might say, one set of approaches focus on ordinary, familiar, everyday facts about us. The fact that we love, the fact that we think, the fact that we experience emotions, what have you--these are ordinary features of us. I'm going to start with those and then I'll turn, eventually, to another set of possible things that might need explaining, which we might think of as extraordinary, supernatural things. Maybe there are certain supernatural things about communication from the dead or near-death experiences that need to be explained in terms of the soul. We'll get to those, but we'll start with ordinary, everyday, hum-drum facts about us. Even though they're ordinary and familiar, it still could turn out that we need to appeal to souls in order to explain them.So, to start, how about this? Start with a familiar fact, which I've already drawn your attention to a couple of times, that you can have a body that's dead. You could have a corpse, and that's clearly not a person. It's not a living being. It's not a person. It doesn't do anything. It just lies there; whereas your body, my body is animated. I move my hands around, my mouth is going up and down, it walks from one part of the stage to the other part of the stage. Maybe we need to appeal to the soul in order to explain what animates the body. The thought would be, when the soul and the body have been separated--such the dualist explains--the soul has lost its ability to give commands to the body. So the body is no longer animated. So we've got a possible explanation of the difference between an animated and an unanimated or an inanimate body to it. Is the soul in contact of the right sort with the body? There's a possible explanation. You might say, \"Look, the physicalist can't tell us that, because all the physical parts are still there when you've got the corpse, at least if it's a fresh corpse before the decay has set in. So, we need to appeal to the existence of a soul in order to explain the animation of bodies like the ones that you and I have.\"Well, I said I was going to run through a series of arguments but that doesn't mean that--the lights have just turned off; I don't know why--that doesn't mean that I think the arguments will all work. I announced on the first day of class that I don't, myself, believe in the existence of a soul. As such, it shouldn't be any surprise to you that what I'm going to do as we run through each of these arguments is to say, \"I'm not convinced by it and here's why.\" Now since I think that the arguments I'm about to sketch--and I've just started sketching the first of is--fails I hope you'll think it over and you'll eventually come to agree with me, yeah, these arguments don't really work after all. But what's more important to me is that you at least think about each of these arguments. Is this a convincing argument for the existence of a soul? If you think so, what response do you want to offer to the objections that I'm giving? If this argument doesn't work, is there another argument for the existence of a soul that you think is a better one?First argument, you need the soul in order to explain the animation of the body. From the physicalist point of view, of course, the answer is going to be \"too quick.\" To have an animated body, you need to have a functioning body. It's true that when you've got a corpse, you've got all the parts there, but clearly they're not functioning properly. But all that shows us is, the parts have broken. Remember my stereo? I dropped my stereo. It falls on the stage. It doesn't work anymore. It stops giving off music. My boombox stops giving off music. That's not because previously--we had a CD inside of it, we had some batteries. We dropped the whole thing. It's not as though previously there was something nonmaterial there. We've got all the same parts there, but the parts are now broken. They're not connected to each other in the right way. The energy is not flowing from the batteries through the wires to the CD component. There's nothing mysterious from the physicalist perspective about the idea that a physical object can break. Although we need to offer a story about what makes the parts work when they're connected with each other and interacting in the right way, there's no need to appeal to anything beyond the physical.Suppose we try to refine the argument. Suppose we say, \"You need to appeal to the soul in order to explain not just that the body moves around, flails, but the body acts purposefully.\" We need something to be pulling the strings, to be directing the body. That's what the soul does, so says the dualist. In response, the physicalist is going to say, \"Yes it's true that bodies don't just move around in random patterns.\" Human bodies don't do that. So we need something to direct it, but why couldn't that just be, one particular part of the body plays the part of the command module? Suppose I've got a heat-seeking missile which tracks down the plane. As the plane tries to dodge it, the missile corrects its course. It's not just moving randomly, it's moving purposefully. There had better be something that explains, that's controlling, the motions of the missile. But for all that, it could just be a particular piece of the missile that does it.More gloriously, we could imagine building some kind of a robot that does a variety of tasks. It's not moving randomly, but the tasks are all controlled by the CPU within the robot. The physicalist says we don't need to appeal to anything as extravagant as a soul in order to explain the fact that bodies don't just move randomly, but they move in purposeful ways that are controlled.For each objection, there's a response. You could imagine the dualist coming back and saying, \"Look, in the case of the heat-seeking missile or the robot for that matter, although it's doing things, it's just obeying orders. And the orders were given to it from something outside itself.\" Something programmed the robot or the missile. So don't we need there to be something outside the body that programs the body? That could be the soul.That's a harder question. Must there be something outside the body that controls the body? One possibility, of course, is, why not say that people are just robots as well and we get our commands from outside? On a familiar religious view, God built Adam out of dirt, out of dust. Adam is just a certain kind of robot then. God breathes into Adam. That's sort of turning it on. Maybe people are just robots commanded from outside by God. But that doesn't mean that there's anything more to us than there is to the robot. That's one possible response. A different response, of course, is why couldn't we have robots that just build more robots? Then, if you ask, \"Where did the commands come from?\" the answer is, \"When they were built, they were built in such a way as to have certain instructions that they begin to follow out.\" Just like people have a genetic code, perhaps, that gives us various instructions that we begin to follow out, or certain innate psychology or what have you.The argument quickly becomes very, very messy. The fan of the soul begins to want to protest, \"Look, we're not just robots. We're not just robots with some sort of program in our brain that we're following. We've got free will. Robots can't have free will. So there's got to be something more to us than robots. We can't just be physical things.\" This is an interesting argument, and I think it's a new argument. We started with the idea you needed to appeal to souls in order to roughly explain why human bodies move, why we're animated or why we move in nonrandom ways. I think it's fairly clear that you don't need to appeal to souls in order to do that. Appeal to a physical body suffices, I think, to have an explanation as to the difference between an animated and an inanimate body, how bodies will move in nonrandom ways. If the brain is our CPU, then we'll behave in deliberate, purposeful ways just like a robot will behave in deliberate, purposeful ways. So this initial argument, I think, is not compelling.Still, we might wonder, what about this new argument? What about the fact that--We said there's a family of arguments, all of which have the general structure, inference to the best explanation, you need souls in order to explain feature F. Plug in a different feature F and you get a new argument. The one we started with--you need the soul to explain the animation of the body--that argument, I think, doesn't work. Now we've got a new one. You need the soul in order to explain free will. Let me come back to that argument later. It's a good argument. It's an argument well worth taking seriously, but let's come back to it later.First, let's run through some other things that might be appealed to as candidates for feature F. Suppose somebody says, \"Look, it's true that we don't need to appeal to souls in order to explain why bodies move around in a nonrandom fashion. But people have a very special ability\"--and so the argument goes--\"that mere bodies couldn't have, physicalists can't explain. That's the ability to think. It's the ability to reason. People have beliefs and desires. And based on their beliefs about how to fulfill their desires, they make plans. They have strategies. They reason about what to do. This tightly connected set of facts about us--beliefs, desires, reasoning, strategizing, planning--you need to appeal to a soul\"--so the argument goes--;\"to explain that. No mere machine could believe. No mere machine has desires. No mere machine could reason.\"It's easy to see why you might think that sort of thing when you stick to simple machines. It's pretty clear that there are lots of machines that it doesn't seem natural to ascribe beliefs or desires or goals or reasoning to. My lawnmower, for example, doesn't want to cut the grass. Even though it does cut the grass, it doesn't have the desire. It doesn't think to itself, \"How shall I get that blade of grass that's been eluding me?\" So it's easy to see why we might be tempted to say no mere machine could think or reason or have beliefs or desires.That argument's much less compelling nowadays than I think it would have been 20 or 40 years ago. In an era of computers with quite sophisticated computer programs, it seems, at the very least, natural to talk about beliefs, desires, and reasoning and strategizing.So suppose, for example, we've got a chess-playing computer. On my computer at home I've got a program that allows my computer to play chess. I, myself, stink at chess. This program can beat me blind. I move my bishop, the computer moves its queen. What do we say about the computer? Why did the computer move its queen, or virtual queen? Why did the computer move its queen? The natural thing to say is, it's worried about the fact that the king is exposed and it's trying to block me by capturing my bishop. That is what we say about computer-playing programs. Think about what we're doing. We're ascribing desires to the program. We're saying it's got an ultimate desire to win the game. A certain subsidiary desire is to protect its king, to capture my king. A certain other subsidiary desire is, no doubt, to protect its various other pieces along the way. It's got beliefs about how to do that by blocking certain paths or by making other pieces on my side vulnerable. It's got beliefs about how to achieve its goals. Then, it puts those combinations of beliefs and desires into action by moving in a way that's a rational response to my move. It looks as though the natural thing to say about the chess-playing computer is, it does have beliefs. It does have desires. It does have intentions. It does have goals. It does reason. It does all of this. It's rational to this limited extent. It's only able to play chess. But to that extent, it's doing all these things and yet we're not tempted to say, are we, that the computer has a nonphysical part? We can explain how the computer does all of this in strictly physical terms. Of course, once you start thinking of it this way, it's natural to talk this way across a variety of things that the computer may be trying to do.It's perfectly open to you, as dualists, to respond by saying, \"Although we personify the computer, we treat it as though it was a person, as though it had beliefs and desires and so forth, it doesn't really have the relevant beliefs and desires, because it doesn't have any beliefs and desires, because no physical object could have beliefs and desires.\" In response to that, I just want to say, \"Isn't that just prejudice?\"Of course, it is true that if we simply insist no physical object could really have beliefs or desires, then it will follow that when we are tempted to ascribe beliefs and desires to my chess-playing computer, we're falling into an illusion. That will follow once we assume that no physical object has beliefs or desires. But what reason is there for saying it has no beliefs or desires? What grounds are there for withholding ascriptions of beliefs and desires to the computer? That's far from obvious.Here's a possibility. Desires, at the very least, seem to be, at least in typical cases, very closely tied to a series of emotions. You get excited when you're playing chess at the prospect of capturing my queen and crushing me. You get worried when your pieces are threatened. Of course, more generally, you get excited, your heart goes pitter-pat, when your girlfriend or boyfriend says they love you. Your stomach sinks, you have that sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach, when you get a bad grade on a test.Maybe what's really going on is the thought that there's an aspect of desire that has a purely behavioral side, that's moving pieces around in a way that would make sense if you had this goal. And maybe machines can do that. But there's an aspect of desires, the emotional side, that machines can't have, but we clearly do have. Maybe we want to build that emotional side into talk of desires.So maybe if we want to say machines don't have a mental life and couldn't have a mental life, what we really mean is no machine could feel anything emotionally. So let's distinguish. Let's say there's a way of talking about beliefs and desires which is just going to be captured in terms of responding in a way that makes sense given the environment. Maybe computers and robots could do that. But there's clearly a side of our mental life, the emotional side, where we might really worry, could a robot feel love? Could it be afraid of anything?Again, our question was, \"Do we need to appeal to souls to explain something about us?\" The physicalist says \"no\"; the dualist says \"yes.\"If what we mean is the mental, but that the aspect, the behavioral aspect of the mental, where even a chess-playing computer probably has it, then that's not a very compelling argument. The physicalist will say, \"Look, that aspect of the mental is pretty clear. We can explain it in physical terms.\" But let's just switch the argument. What about emotions? Can a robot feel emotions? Could a purely physical being fall in love? Could it be afraid of things? Could it hope for something? The latest version of our argument then is, \"People can feel emotions. But if you think about it, it's pretty clear no robot could feel emotions. No merely physical thing could feel emotions. So there must be more to us than a merely physical thing.\" That's the argument we'll start with next time.[end of transcript]"},"lct04.html":{"url":"lct04.html","title":"Lecture 4","keywords":"","body":"Death: Lecture 4 TranscriptJanuary 25, 2007    Professor Shelly Kagan: We've been talking about the question, \"What arguments might be offered for the existence of a soul?\" And the family of arguments that we're considering initially are arguments that get known as inference or inferences to the best explanation. The thought is that there's something about us that needs explaining. We can't explain it in terms of‚Ä¶ in purely physical terms. And so we need to appeal to, we need to posit, the existence of, a soul. Now, I'll come back to that sort of argument in just a minute, but let me bracket that for a moment and say something about Plato.Starting next week, we're going to be looking at Plato's dialogue, the Phaedo. And so although I'll be saying a great deal about the Phaedo once we turn to it, I want to just take a minute or two and say a couple of introductory remarks. I don't know how many of you have not read any Plato before, but for those of you who haven't, I actually think you're in for a treat. Plato is not only one of the greatest philosophers in history, he wrote his philosophy in the form of dialogues. That is to say, plays, in which various characters sit around or stand around and argue about philosophical positions. The particular dialogue that we're going to be reading, the Phaedo, is set at the death scene of Socrates. As I'm sure you know, Socrates was put on trial, condemned to death for corrupting the youth of Athens--and perhaps, among other things, for arguing philosophy with them. And he's given hemlock, poison, and he drinks it and he dies.Now, this is a historical event. Socrates had a circle of friends and disciples that he would argue philosophy with. One of his disciples was Plato. Plato then grew up and wrote philosophical works. Plato does not typically appear in his own dialogues. Or, if he does, he's only there as a minor character. In fact, if I recall correctly, Plato's mentioned as not being there on the day that Socrates dies. So, how do we know, if we've got this play, whose position is Plato's position? And the answer--the short answer--is, Socrates, the character Socrates in the play, represents Plato, the author of the play's, philosophical views. Now, in fact, if this were a class in ancient philosophy, we'd have to complicate that picture, because it's fairly clear that by late in Plato's career Plato has philosophical views that are very much unlike the views of his teacher, Socrates. And yet Plato continues to not appear in the dialogue. Socrates continues to be sort of the hero. And so scholars debate which of the views put forward by Socrates in which ones of the dialogues represent views that belong to the actual historical figure Socrates, and which of the views put forward by the character Socrates in which of the dialogues represent views that are actually not held by the historical Socrates, but were instead held by the historical Plato and were merely put in the mouth of the character Socrates.Scholars distinguish between the early Platonic dialogues, the so-called Socratic dialogues, where the thought is, those are the views of Socrates, the actual historical figure. And then there's the late dialogues, where even though Socrates appears, most scholars believe those are probably not the views that the historical Socrates actually believed. You have middle dialogues where you have to worry about whose views are whose. But we're not going to worry. This is not a class in ancient philosophy. So for our purposes, we don't have to ask ourselves when Socrates in the dialogue says something, is this a view that the dead man Socrates actually would have held or is this simply a view that the dead man Plato put in the mouth of the character Socrates? For our purposes, it won't really matter. I'll take every view that Socrates puts forward as a view of Plato's, though I'll typically sort of run back and forth sort of in a careless fashion. I'll say, \"Plato holds\" or \"Socrates argues,\" because for our purposes it's all the same.But there's one other complication that you've got to be warned about, which is this. Because these are dialogues and they take the form of philosophical arguments, people put forward views and then, over the course of the discussion, change their minds about things. And they take them back. And maybe something similar is going on when Socrates says something. Because, after all, this isn't Plato saying, \"Here's what I believe explicitly.\" He's just writing a dramatic play about philosophy. And so sometimes we'll find ourselves thinking, \"You know, there's an argument here that Socrates is putting forward. But maybe it's not a very good argument.\" And it will, at least, be worth pausing periodically to ask ourselves, maybe Plato realized it wasn't a very good argument. We can often better understand the dialogues by seeing Socrates as putting forward certain positions that he does not think are altogether adequate. And he modifies them or revises them or introduces new positions to deal with some of the difficulties that he was setting himself to be open to earlier. As I say, don't worry about any of those details now, but it's a point to keep in mind as you read the dialogues. So that's all I really wanted to say by way of introduction.You should start reading the Phaedo for next week. We'll be talking about the Phaedo starting some time next week and we'll continue the discussion of the Phaedo for at least a bit of, maybe all of, the week after that. In the case of Plato, I'm going to make an exception. Normally, I will mention our readings, but I won't spend a lot of time actually discussing them in detail. That's why you have to think of the readings as complementing the lectures or think of the lectures as complementing the readings. I'm not just giving the Cliff Notes, as it were, of the readings. Nonetheless, in the case of the Phaedo, I am going to spend more time actually saying, \"Here's what I think the first main argument is. Let's try to reconstruct it in terms of its premises and its conclusions. Here are some objections I raise. Here is then the next argument that Plato offers. Let's try to get that up in premises.\" Even there, I won't be spending time reading out loud long passages from the Phaedo. But, in some sense, I'll be giving a closer commentary of the Phaedo than I'll do for the other readings. So, still, what you should do is start reading it for next week.The topic of the Phaedo, as I say, is set on Socrates' last day. At the end of the dialogue, he drinks the hemlock and he dies. And perhaps unsurprisingly, what he does with his friends up until that moment is, he argues about the immortality of the soul. Quite strikingly, Socrates is not upset. He's not worried about the fact that he's going to die. He actually welcomes this in a certain way, because he believes his soul is immortal. And so, in addition to philosophical arguments for and against the existence and immortality of the soul, we end the dialogue with a quite moving death scene, one of the great death scenes, if we could call it that, of western civilization. Anyway, as I say, that's all for next week.So let's return now to the question, \"How might we argue for the existence of the soul?\" Initially, last time, we considered a set of or a subset of arguments that basically said, \"Look, there's got to be more to us than just material objects. People can't just be machines, because machines can't reason. Machines can't think.\" And I said, \"That doesn't seem to be a compelling argument.\" After all, chess-playing computers, it seems, can reason. They have beliefs about what I'm likely to do next. They have desires about the goals that they're trying to achieve. They reason about how best to defeat me. And it's worth pointing out that--a point that I didn't make last time--it's worth pointing out that, what the computers, at least the best chess-playing computers don't do. Indeed, no computer actually does this.You might think that what a computer, what a chess-playing computer does is just this. It calculates every possible branch, every possible game from here on out. And then it sort of works backwards. \"Oh, these are the ones where I'll win.\" And so it only makes the move where it can sort of look ahead 20 moves, right, and see which branches have the computer winning. That is not the way chess-playing programs work. For the simple reason that the number of possible chess games is so huge, that computers can't calculate it. They'd be busy for thousands of years. We can do that sort of: When you play tic-tac-toe with your seven-year old nephew or niece, you just look ahead and work backwards. \"Well, if I do that, he'll do that and he'll do that and then he wins, so I won't do that,\" right? But we can't do that with chess. There's just too many games.So how do chess-playing programs, and particularly the best chess-playing programs, how do they work? Well, they play chess the same way you do. They have various ideas about which pieces are more powerful and so they're more important to protect. They've got various ideas about which strategies tend to be successful. What sorts of dangers come along with them? If you're a serious chess player, you might study some of the great games of chess history. And indeed, when they program these things, the programmers will feed in game after game after game of the great chess games in history. And then armed with all of that, you sort of do your best. And when you lose a game, you kind of make a mental note to yourself, \"That really screwed me up. Let me try something different next time.\" And you avoid those sorts of moves. That's how chess-playing programs work as well.Jumping ahead, let me make a remark about this, because this is going to be relevant for something I'll get to in a couple of minutes. What this means--what this, the implication--is that if you're playing a great chess-playing program, it's not as though the way to tell what it's going to do is to study its program and think it through. The people who design these programs, presumably fairly decent chess players themselves, the people who design these programs, when they're playing the programs they're not thinking to themselves, \"Let's see. I programmed this computer so that when I move a queen forward to this space, it should come out with a bishop.\" That's hopeless. Because the program is constantly revising its strategies, in light of what's worked and what hasn't worked in the past. When the programmers play these programs or indeed when anybody, a good chess player, plays these programs, the best way to try to beat them is simply ask yourself, \"What's the best move to make right now?\" The odds are the computer's going to make the best possible move. Treat the computer as though it were just a great chess player.And indeed, the best programs are great chess players. There was a period of time in which, although there were decent, chess-playing programs couldn't beat the best chess-playing humans. That ended some years ago when the best programs began to beat grand masters. And now it's in fact the case that the best programs can beat pretty much anybody. In the current world champion of chess, I think Vladimir Kramnik, was defeated in December by a chess-playing program. So Kramnik's simply treating this as an awesome opponent. And that's the best way to deal with these things. All right. So, bracket some of those thoughts for a moment. We'll come back to them a little bit later when we start talking about the question, \"Could machines be creative?\" Tipping my hand, it seems pretty clear that that seems like the right thing to say about these chess-playing programs.So we had the question, \"Could machines, could machines reason?\" And although we don't have machines that can reason about a lot of subjects yet, it seems pretty clear. It seems like the natural thing to suggest, machines can reason in at least some areas. And so it doesn't seem plausible to suggest that we people must not be physical, merely physical, because after all, we can reason and no machine can reason. No, machines could reason.But this prompts a different move on the part of the defender of souls. Perhaps the argument shouldn't be, \"we have to believe in souls because no mere physical object could reason.\" Perhaps the argument should be, \"we have to believe in souls because no mere physical object, no machine could feel.\" You know, we have emotions. We love. We're afraid. We're worried. We'll get elated. We get depressed. So perhaps the argument should go \"Yeah, yeah, thinking, that's the sort of thing a machine can do. You know, we call them thinking machines. But feeling, that's the sort of thing no machine could do. No purely physical object could feel anything, could have emotions. And so, since we clearly do feel things, there must be more to us than a physical object.\"Now, I think it is plausible to suggest that unlike the case of chess-playing computers, we don't yet have machines that feel things. But the question isn't, \"do we?\" The question is, \"could there be a machine that could feel something, could have an emotion of some sort?\" So let's go a little science fictiony and think about some of the robots that have been shown in science fiction movies, some of the computer programs that have been shown in science fiction movies, science fiction novels, or what have you. When I was a kid there was a television show called Lost in Space. I'm afraid I've forgotten the name of the robot that was on that show. But as it was a TV show and so sure enough, every single episode, some new dramatic danger would take place. And the robot would start whizzing and binging and shout out, \"Danger, Commander Robinson!\" \"Danger, Will Robinson!\" that was it. \"Danger, Will Robinson!\" It seemed as though the robot was worried.More recent example. A number of you have probably read some of Douglas Adams' books The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the sequels to that. There's a robot in those books, Marvin, who's --depressed, I think is the simple word about it. He sort of--He is very smart. He's thought about the universe, thinks life is pointless and he acts depressed. He talks to another robot, depresses the other robot. The other robot commits suicide. All right. Seems natural to ascribe depression to Marvin, the robot. That's how he behaves. Or, my favorite example, the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. Now, I've got to tell you, for those of you who have not seen this movie, I'm about to spoil it. All right? So you cover your ears.In 2001: A Space Odyssey, we get some kind of indication that there's life on another planet. It's all very mysterious and we send off a spaceship to investigate the markings, the radio signals from the other place. This is a very important mission and so there is a computer program named Hal that helps run the ship and takes a lot of the burdens off of the part of the human astronauts who are on the ship. Hal's got the goal--in terms of reasoning and desires and so forth and so on--Hal's got the goal of making sure the mission is successful. But Hal thinks to himself fairly plausibly, humans really screw things up. This is a very important mission. Let's kill the humans to make sure they don't screw things up. One of the astronauts, discovering the plot, attempts to stop Hal. And proceeds to do the only thing he can do to defend himself against Hal, which is shut down the program, basically killing--if we can talk that way--killing Hal. Meanwhile, as all this is going on, Hal and Dave, the human astronaut, are talking to each other. Hal realizes what's going on. Hal tries to stop Dave, understandably enough. And Hal says, as Dave begins to shut down Hal's circuits, \"I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Dave.\" What's he afraid of? He's afraid of dying. It seems perfectly natural to ascribe fear to Hal. Hal is behaving in exactly the way you would expect him to behave, or it to behave, if it felt fear. It's got reason to be afraid. It's behaving appropriately. It's telling us that it's afraid. It seems natural to say Hal's afraid.Now, you could continue to sort of fill in examples like this. As I say, of course, they're all science fiction, but the fact that we can grasp--and it's not as though we go running away saying, \"Oh no! This was outrageous,\" right? \"It makes no sense to think a computer could have said, ‚ÄòI'm afraid.' It makes no sense to think that it could try to kill the people who are trying to shut it down and so forth.\" That seems to me to be prejudice, as I said last time. The natural inclination here is to say, \"These computer programs, these robots are feeling emotion.\" But there's no particular reason to think there's anything going on there than the circuits. They're just physical objects, programs on machines. If that's right, if that's the right thing to say, then what we have to say is, \"We don't need to appeal to souls in order to explain emotions and feelings. Physical objects could have, mere physical objects could have, emotions and feelings. So we have no reason to posit the existence of a soul.\"Now, I think the best response on the part of the dualist to this reply is to distinguish two aspects of feelings, two aspects of emotions. There's the behavioral aspect of feeling fear, let's say. The behavioral aspect is when you're aware in the environment of something that poses a danger to you, that will harm you or destroy you, or in the case of a computer program, turn you off, then you take various kinds of behaviors in opposition to that to try to disarm the danger, to try to neutralize it. This is just a matter of beliefs, goals, responses, planning, the sort of thing that we already saw the chess-playing computer can do, that behavioral side of emotion. It seems pretty plausible to think robots could do that. Physical objects could do that.But, and here's the crucial point of this objection, there's another side or another aspect to emotions and feelings. It's the sensation of what it's feeling like--that's why we call them feelings after all--what it's feeling like on the inside, as it were, while all this behavioral stuff's going on. When I'm afraid, I have this certain sort of clammy feeling or my heart's going poundingly. Your blood is racing. When you're afraid, you've got this sinking feeling in the stomach. When you're depressed, there are these, well, we could call them experiences, though the word \"experience\" is also somewhat ambiguous. So--we'll use it for the moment--there's an experience that goes along with each emotion. There's what it feels like to you when you're afraid. What it feels like to you when you're worried or depressed or joyful or in love. And the thought, and I think this is a pretty powerful thought, is that even if the robots are behaving behaviorally, they've got the behavior side of the emotions down, they don't have the feeling side at all.Now, once you start thinking these thoughts, there's no need to restrict yourself to emotions. The missing stuff, the missing thing is there in all sorts of familiar humdrum ways as well. So right now I'm looking at the chairs in the auditorium. They're some kind of shade of blue. Think about--Look at some places in the room where the curtains with their red. Think about what it's like to see red, the sensation of seeing red. Now again, we've got to distinguish between what I'll continue to call the behavioral side of seeing red and the experiential side of seeing red. It's easy enough for us to build a machine that can tell red from blue. It just checks and sees what kind of light frequencies are bouncing off the object. So we can build a machine that could sort red balls from blue balls. My son has a little robot that can do that. Still, when you think to yourself, what's the--what's going on inside the machine? What does it feel like to be the machine while it's looking at--while it's got its little light sensors pointed at--the red ball? Does it have the sensation of seeing red? What I suppose you want to say, certainly what I want to say is, \"No, no, it doesn't have that sensation at all.\" It's sorting things based on the light frequencies, but it doesn't have the experience of seeing red.What we're trying to get at here is--it can be very elusive, but I imagine most of you are familiar with it. It's the sort of thing you wonder about when you ask yourself, \"If somebody was born blind, could he possibly know what it's like to see color?\" He might be a scientist and know all sorts of things about how light works. You use such and such frequencies, and which objects, and you hand him an apple and he'll say, \"Oh, it must be very red,\" right? Maybe he points his little light detector at it and it reads out. It says, \"This is such and such a frequency.\" And he says, \"Oh, this is a very red apple, much redder than that tomato\" or whatever. But for all that, we've got the notion, not only is he not seeing red, he can't even imagine what it's like to see red, never having had these experiences. And once you start to see this, we realize, of course, our life is filled with this aspect. Things have colors. Things have sounds. Things have smells. There is the qualitative aspect of experience.And the point that I started with earlier, about the internal aspect of emotions, is it's not just out there, but inside as well. We have certain kinds of sensations inside our body, the characteristic sensation of fear or joy or depression. All right. So the suggestion then might be this. What no physical object can get right, because no physical object can get at all, is the qualitative aspect of experience. That's the aspect that we're after when we ask ourselves, \"What's it like to see red? What's it like to smell coffee or to taste pineapple?\" Now, it's pretty--Philosophers sometimes call these things qualia, because of the notion of the qualitative aspects of things. Our experiences have qualitative properties. And the suggestion then might be, no physical object, no mere machine could possibly have qualitative experience. But we've got it, so we're no mere physical object. We're no mere machine.All right. Now, that's the objection. It's a pretty good objection. And then the question is, \"What can the physicalist say in response?\" Now, the best possible response would be for the physicalist to say, \"Here's how to build a machine that can be conscious in this sense. That is, have a qualitative experience. Here's how to do it. Here's how to--Just like we can explain in materialist, physicalist terms how to get desires and beliefs and the behavioral stuff down, here's how to get the feeling, qualitative aspect of things down, too.\" It would be best if the physicalist could give us that kind of story. I think the truth of the matter has to be--I think the answer right now is, we don't know how to give that story. Consciousness, if what we mean by consciousness is this qualitative aspect of our mental life, consciousness remains a pretty big mystery. We don't know how to explain it in physicalist terms. And it's because of that that I think we shouldn't be dismissive of the dualist when the dualist says, \"We've got to believe in souls in order to explain it.\"We shouldn't be dismissive, but that's not to say that I think we should be convinced. Because it's one thing to say we don't yet know how to explain consciousness in physical terms. It's another thing to say we won't ever be able to explain consciousness in physical terms. If we had the latter--excuse me--If we had the bold claim that no physical object could see red, taste honey, then we'd have to conclude since we can do all that, we're not a physical object or not merely a physical object. But I don't think we're yet in a position to say that. I think the simple fact of the matter is we don't know enough about consciousness yet to know whether or not it can be explained in physical terms.When I think about this situation, an analogy always occurs to me. Imagine that we're somewhere in, let's say, the fourteenth century trying to understand life, the life of plants. A plant is a living thing. And we ask ourselves, \"Could it possibly be that life could be explained in material terms?\" It's got to seem very mysterious to us. How could it be? When we think of the kinds of examples of material machines that we've got available to us in the fourteenth century, I try to imagine what would somebody in the fourteenth century think to himself or herself when he entertains the possibility that a plant might just be a machine? And then, I have this little image of some plant made out of gears, right? And the gears begin turning and the bud opens, dot, dot, dot, dot. And the person's just going to say, \"My god! That wouldn't be alive!\" So it's pretty obvious that no machine could be alive. No material object could be alive. In order to explain life, we have to appeal to something more than just atoms. They didn't have atoms, but more than just matter. Life requires something immaterial above and beyond matter to explain it.That would have been an understandable position to come to in the fourteenth century, but it would have been wrong. We didn't have a clue back then how to explain life in material terms. But that didn't mean it couldn't be done. I'm inclined to think the same thing is true right now for us and consciousness. I know there are theories out there. But my best take is we're pretty much like in the fourteenth century. We don't really have a clue yet, or not much of a clue, as to how you could even so much as begin to--it's not that merely that we don't have the details worked out. We don't even have the picture in broad strokes as far as consciousness is concerned, of how it could be done in physical terms.But not seeing how it's possible is not the same thing as seeing that it's impossible. If the dualist comes and says, \"Can't you just see that it's not remotely possible, it's not conceivably possible, for a purely physical object to have experiences, to have qualia?\" what I want to say is, \"No, I don't see that it's impossible. I admit I don't see how to do it, but I don't see that it's impossible.\" So I don't feel forced to posit the existence of a soul.Of course, the fan of the soul could come back and say, \"But that's not fair. The question isn't, ‚ÄòIs this explanation impossible?' The question is just, ‚ÄòWho's got the better explanation?' You guys can't offer any kind of explanation at all, yet. I can offer an explanation. How is consciousness possible? We have souls. Souls are really very different from physical objects and so they can be conscious.\"But at this point, I think it's crucial to remember the point that it's not just the question, \"Who's got an explanation?\" but, \"Who's got the better explanation?\" And before we say that the soul view's got the better explanation, we have to ask ourselves, just how much of an explanation is it to say, \"Oh I can explain consciousness. Consciousness is housed not in the body, but in the soul.\" Okay. \"How exactly is it that a soul can be conscious?\" we ask. And then the soul theorist says, \"Well, uhm.. er.. ah.. it just can.\" That's not really much of an explanation. I don't feel I've got any sort of account going here as to how consciousness works, even if I become a dualist. If the dualist were to start offering us some elaborate theory of consciousness, \"Well, there's these sorts of soul structures, and those sorts of soul structures, and these create these sensations and those create those sensations. And here's a theory,\" well, then, I'll begin to take it seriously as an explanation. But if all the soul theorist is just saying is \"Nah, nah. You guys can't explain it and I can, because I say this is an explanation.\" then, I find myself wanting to say, \"That's not really any better. That's no improvement at all.\"There was a question or a comment.Student: [inaudible]Professor Shelly Kagan: Good. So the question was--First, it was the accusation before the question, that I'm holding a sort of double standard. I'm defending, I'm defending the physicalist by saying, \"Don't blame us. We don't know how to explain it yet.\" Why aren't I allowing the soul theory to say, \"Don't blame us. We don't know how to explain it yet.\" Good question. And my answer is--And sometimes I think this one's a tie. I think the soul theorist doesn't have an explanation. The physical theorist doesn't have an explanation. As far as I can see, right now nobody's got a good explanation about how consciousness works. It's a bit of a mystery right now. So I don't mean--I hope I haven't been doing this. It's not so much a double standard is needed; it's a tie. But notice if it's a tie, that doesn't give us what we were looking for. What we were looking for, after all, was some reason to believe in souls. And if the best the soul theorist can say is, \"I can't explain it and neither can you,\" that's not a reason to believe this side.We already believe there are bodies. We already know bodies can do some pretty amazing things. The question we're asking is, \"Is there a good reason to add to our list of things there are? Is there a good reason to add the soul, something immaterial?\" And if the best that the soul theorist has is, \"maybe we need this to explain something that I don't see how you guys can explain, maybe this would help, though I can't quite see how either,\" that's not a very compelling argument. So what I'm inclined to think with regard to this particular strand or this particular version of the argument is, the jury's still out. Maybe at the end of the day we'll give it our best. We'll decide you can't explain consciousness in physical terms. We'll begin to work out some sort of alternative immaterial theory. Maybe at the end of the day we will decide we need to believe in souls. But right now, I don't think the evidence supports that conclusion.Still, there's other possibilities. Consider creativity. Here's another version of an argument that goes from inference to the best explanation. Creativity. It says, \"People can be creative.\" We write new pieces of music. We write poems. We prove things in mathematics that have never been proven before or we find new ways to prove these theorems or what have you and we can be creative. No mere machine can be creative. So we must be something more than a mere machine. Well, then, the question is going to be, \"Could it be a case that there could be a physical object that's creative?\" And I'm inclined to think, \"Yes.\" In fact, I already suggested as much when I talked about the chess-playing computers. The chess-playing computer programs think of moves, think of strategies no one's thought of before. In the most straightforward natural meaning of the term, we have to say--I think the program that beat the world champion was called Deep Fritz. So when Deep Fritz beat Kramnik, it was being creative. It made a move that Kramnik didn't think of and perhaps nobody had. Perhaps no chess game before had had this move.Computers can do other sorts of things of this sort. There are mathematical theorem-proving programs. Now, some of these things can prove things that are mathematically way over my head. But let's take something simple like the Pythagorean Theorem, which we all learned in high school. And we learned how to prove the Pythagorean Theorem in Euclidean geometry, starting with the various axioms in Euclidean geometry, ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba bum. This proves Pythagorean Theorem. And it turns out there's a variety of proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. And, in fact, a computer program has come up with a proof that, as far as was known, nobody in the world had ever come up with before. Well, other than prejudice, what would stop us from saying the program was being creative? Not just in sort of mathematical things like chess or math, there are, as you know, programs that can write music. And I don't just mean throw out some random assortment of notes. Programs that can produce music that have--that we recognize as music, that have melodic structure and develop themes, resolve, music that nobody's heard before. Why not say the machine is creative? What, other than prejudice, would stop us from saying that? So if the argument's going to be, \"We need to posit the existence of a soul in order to explain creativity,\" again, that just seems wrong. Well, there's a--question, comment?Student: [inaudible]Professor Shelly Kagan: Good. The question was, \"When I talk about creativity here, am I trying to build in some appeal to the feeling that we may have when we're being creative?\" And the answer is, \"No.\" All I had in mind, as you know, is just--in talking about the creativity issue--I just have in mind producing something new, producing something that hasn't been around before. And most particularly, producing something that your programmers didn't already have in mind. Remember, it's not as though the people who designed the chess-playing programs can beat it. The chess-playing program makes moves these guys haven't thought of. All right.The creativity argument may not work, but there's something that sort of immediately comes on its heels. Even if we could build a program, even if we had built programs that can be creative, that can do things that nobody's thought of before, all the program is doing is following its program, right? It's just a series of lines of code. And the robot or the computer or what have you is just automatically, mechanically following the code commands of the program. We might say, even if we are smart enough to build programs that can, by mechanistically following the program, do things we've never thought of, still all the computer can do, all the robot can do is automatically, necessarily, mechanically follow the program. It doesn't have free will. But we have free will.So, here's a new argument for the existence of the soul. People have free will. No merely mechanical object, no robot, no computer could have free will. But since we've got free will, we must be something more than a merely physical object. There must be something extra, something immaterial about us, the soul. So maybe that's why we need to believe in souls in order to explain free will. Now, the subject, free will, is a very, very--The subject of consciousness is a very complicated. One could have an entire semester devoted to thinking about the philosophical problem of consciousness. And indeed, as it happens, in our department this very semester there is such a class devoted, all semester, to the topic of consciousness. One could similarly have a course devoted to the problem of free will. I'm going to spend all of two minutes on it. So it's by no means do I mean to suggest, \"Oh, here's everything you need to know about the subject.\" I simply want to point out enough about the problem to help you see why I don't think free will is a slam-dunk for the soul.So what's the argument? Well, the thought seems to be something like this. [See Figure 4.1] One, we have free will. Two--let me say something about this. What is it about the thought that the computer is just following a program? Well, the thought, I suppose is, in philosopher's jargon, that the computer is a deterministic system. It follows the laws of physics and the laws of physics are deterministic. If you're in this state, you will necessarily, given the laws of physics and the way the computer's programmed and built and so forth, these wires will turn on, turn off, these circuits will turn on, turn off, boom, suddenly you'll be in that state. There are certain laws such that, given that the computer's in this state, it must necessarily move in that state. When you've got a view about cause and effect that works this way--for everything that happens, there's some earlier thing that caused it to happen such that given that earlier cause, the event had to follow--that's a deterministic picture. And the thought, of course, is that the robot or the computer is a deterministic system and you can't have free will if you're a deterministic system.So number one, we have free will. Two, nothing subject to determinism has free will. Put one and two together. It follows, if nothing subject to determinism has free will, but we have free will, it follows that we're not subject to determinism. Suppose we then add three, all purely physical systems are subject to determinism. Well, one and two gave us that we are not subject to determinism. Three says, all purely physical systems are subject to determinism. Well, it would follow then from one, two, and three that we are not a purely physical system. So, conclusion, four, we are not a purely physical system.All right. That's the argument from free will. Now, the argument is valid. That's philosopher's jargon, that is to say, given the three premises, the conclusion really does follow. The interesting question is, \"Are the three premises true?\" And they've got to all be true. It's got to be that every single one of them is so. I'll just spend a minute more on this starting next time. But the point to think about for next time is just, is it really true that all three of the premises are true, or might one or more of them be false? All right. That's where we'll start next time.[end of transcript]"},"lct05.html":{"url":"lct05.html","title":"Lecture 5","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 5 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: All right. We've been talking about\narguments that might give us reason to believe in the existence of an\nimmaterial soul. The kinds of arguments we've been considering so far\nall fall under the general rubric of \"inference to the best\nexplanation.\" We posit--or the fans of souls posit--the existence of\nsouls so as to explain something that needs explaining about us. I've\ngone through a series of such arguments, and the one that we ended with\nlast time was the suggestion that we need to believe in the existence\nof a soul in order to explain the fact that we've got free will. The\nfact that we've got free will is something that most of us take for\ngranted about ourselves. But the complaint then, or the objection to\nthe physicalist, takes the form that we couldn't be a merely physical\nentity because no merely physical entity could have free will. But\nwe've got free will, so there's got to be something more to us than\njust being a physical object. Now, if we push the dualist to explain\nwhat is it about free will that rules out the possibility that we are\nmerely physical objects, I think the natural suggestion to spell out\nthe argument goes like this, and this is where we were at the end of\nlast time.\n\nThe thought is that, there's a kind of incompatibility with being\nfree and being determined. I mean, after all from the physicalist's\npoint of view, we're just a kind of glorified robot, able to do all\nsorts of things that most robots in most science fiction movies can do.\nBut still, in a sense, we're just a glorified physical object. We're\njust a robot. And robots, the objection goes, are programmed; they\nnecessarily follow their program. More generally speaking, we might\nsay, they're subject to deterministic laws--that, as physical objects,\nit's true of them that they must do what the laws of physics and laws\nof nature require that they do. And the laws of physics are--take a\ndeterministic form, determinism being a bit of philosopher's jargon for\nwhen it's true of these laws that--or a physical--or a system--that if\nyou set it up a certain way, cause and effect plays out such that,\ngiven that initial setup, the very same effect must follow. It's\ndetermined by the laws of nature that the effect that follows will\nfollow from that cause. And so, if you rewind the tape and play it\nagain over and over and over again, each time you set things up the\nvery same way they must move or transform or change or end up in the\nvery same state. Well, that's what determinism is all about.\n\nAnd intuitively, it seems plausible to many people that you couldn't\nhave free will and be subject to determinism. Because the notion of\nfree will was that even if I was in the very same spot again, the very\nsame situation again, I could've chosen differently. So I wasn't\ndetermined or predetermined to make that choice. So if we were to spell\nout the argument somewhat more fully, it might be, \"We have free will,\nbut you can't both have free will and be subject to determinism or\nsubject to deterministic laws.\" And every physical object, or every\npurely physical object, is subject to deterministic laws because the\nlaws of physics are deterministic. You put these things together and\nyou get the conclusion that we, since we've got free will, can't be a\npurely physical object. There must be something more than the purely\nphysical to us.\n\nThat's the argument I put up on the board at the end of last class.\nAnd here we've got it up here now. [See Figure 5.1] One, we have free\nwill. Two, nothing subject to determinism has free will. Three, all\npurely physical systems are subject to determinism. So--a\nconclusion--we are not a purely physical system. To explain the fact\nthat we've got free will, so the objection goes, we have to appeal\nto--we have to posit--the existence of a soul, something non-physical,\nsomething more than purely physical. Well, that's the argument. But I\ndon't myself find the argument compelling. Now, the first thing to\nnotice is that to get the conclusion we need all three premises. Give\nup the conclusion that we've got--Give up the premise that \"we've got\nfree will,\" it won't follow that we're non-physical. Even if something\nthat did have free will would have to be non-physical, it wouldn't\nfollow that we're non-physical. That's true for each one of the\npremises. Give it up, the conclusion doesn't go through. And the\ninteresting thing is that each one of these premises could be plausibly\nchallenged.\n\nNow, as I said last time, the subject of free will--or free will,\ndeterminism, causation and responsibility, this cluster of problems--is\nan extremely difficult and complicated physical problem. And we could\neasily devote an entire semester to discussing it. So all we're doing\nhere is the most quick and superficial glance. But still, let me\nquickly point out why you could resist the argument from free will to\nthe existence of a soul. First of all, as I just noted, the argument\nneeds premise number one. It's got to be the case, to prove that we've\ngot a soul--at least for this argument to work to prove that we've got\na soul--it's got to be the case that we've got free will.\n\nNow, that could be challenged. There are philosophers who have said\nwe certainly believe that we've got free will, but it's an illusion. We\ndon't really have free will. Indeed, why don't we have free will? For\nprecisely the reasons that are pointed to by the rest of the argument.\nThey might say, \"Oh, well, you know, we're physical objects;\ndeterminism is true of us. No physical object that's subject to\ndeterminism could have free will, so we don't have free will. Of\ncourse, we mistakenly believe we've got free will. We are physical\nobjects that labor under the illusion that we have free will, but after\nall, free will isn't something that you can just see, right? You can't\npeer into your mind and see the fact that you've got free will. Yes,\nwe've got the sense that we could've acted differently, but maybe\nthat's an illusion.\" As I say, there are philosophers who've argued\nthat way, have denied that we have free will and if we do conclude that\nwe don't actually have free will, then we no longer have this argument\nfor the existence of a soul. It's a way to avoid the argument;\nalthough, for what it's worth, I should mention I don't myself believe\nthat it's false that we have free will. That is to say, I do think\npremise one is true. I myself think we do have free will. So although I\ndon't like, I don't believe the argument is sound--premise one doesn't\nhappen to be the premise I myself would want to reject.\n\nBut there are other, there are two other key premises. What about\npremise number three, \"All purely physical systems are subject to\ndeterminism.\" Well, we need that premise as well to make the argument\ngo. Suppose we think, \"Look, you can't have free will and determinism.\nYou can't combine them.\" The view that you can't combine them is\nsometimes known as \"incompatibilism\" for the obvious reason. It's the\nview that these two things are incompatible. You can't have determinism\nand free will. Suppose we do believe in incompatibilism and believe\nthat we've got free will. It would follow then that we're not subject\nto deterministic laws. Well, the dualist says, \"That shows us that we\nhave to believe that there's something non-physical about us. Because\nafter all, premise three: ‚ÄòAll purely physical systems are subject to\ndeterminism.' Isn't it true after all that the basic laws of physics\nare deterministic laws?\" And the answer is, \"Well it's not so clear\nthat it is true.\" Which is just to say that premise three of the\nargument can be rejected as well.\n\nNow, at this point I have to just confess, as I've confessed at\nother times before, three is a claim about empirical science. What does\nour best theory about the laws of nature tell us? And I'm no scientist\nand I'm no specialist in sort of empirical matters, and believe me, I'm\nno authority on quantum mechanics, our best theory of fundamental\nphysics. Still, I take it--I gather--here's what I'm told--that the\nstandard interpretation of quantum mechanics says that, despite what\nmany of us might've otherwise believed, the fundamental laws of physics\nare not, in fact, deterministic.\n\nWhat does that mean? Suppose we've got some sort of radioactive\natom, which has a certain chance of decaying. What does that mean?\nWell, it means that, you know, there's maybe, let's say, an 80 percent\nchance that in the next 24 hours it will break down. Eighty percent of\natoms that are set up like that break down in the next 24 hours; 20\npercent of them don't. Now, according to quantum mechanics under the\nstandard interpretation, that's all there is to say about it. You have\nan atom like that, 80 percent chance in the next 24 hours it will break\ndown.\n\nSuppose it does break down! Can we say why it broke down? Sure. We\ncan say, \"Well, after all there was an 80 percent chance that it\nwould.\" Take an atom that after 24 hours hasn't broken down. Can we say\nwhy it hasn't broken down? Sure. There was a 20 percent chance that it\nwouldn't. Can we explain why the ones that do break down break down and\nthe ones that don't break down don't break down? No. All we can say is,\nthere was an 80 percent chance it would, 20 percent chance it wouldn't,\nso most of them do, some of them don't. That's as deep as the\nexplanation goes. There is nothing more. Now, you know, when we've got\nour deterministic hats on, we think to ourselves, \"There's got to be\nsome underlying causal explanation, some feature about the break-down\natoms that explains why they broke down and that was missing from the\nnon-break-down atoms that explains why they don't break down. After\nall, determinism, right? If you set up the atoms exactly the same way,\nthey've always got to break down.\" But the answer is, according to the\nstandard interpretation of quantum mechanics, that's not how it works.\nAll there is to say is, \"Some of these are going to break down, and\nsome of these won't.\"\n\nThe fundamental laws of physics, according to the standard\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics, are probabilistic. Determinism is\nnot true at the level of fundamental physics. Well, that's what I'm\ntold. Believe me, I'm in no position to say, but that's what I'm told.\nAnd of course, if that's true, then premise three is false. It just\nisn't true that all purely physical systems are subject to determinism.\nSo even if it does turn out that you can't have free will and\ndeterminism, that doesn't rule out the possibility that we are purely\nphysical objects, because not all purely physical systems are subject\nto determinism. If determinism isn't true of us at the fundamental\nlevel, then even if you couldn't both have determinism and free will,\nwe could still have free will, and yet, for all that, still be purely\nphysical systems.\n\nWhile I'm busy pointing out ways in which the argument doesn't\nsucceed, I also want to just take a moment and mention that premise two\nis also subject to criticism. Premise two was the incompatibilist claim\nthat, \"nothing subject to determinism has free will.\" You can't combine\nthem. They're incompatible. Now, incompatibilism, I take it, is\nprobably something like the common-sense view here. It's the view that\nprobably most of you believe, but again, it's worth noting that\nphilosophically it can be challenged. There are philosophers--and here\nI'll tip my hat and say, I'm one of them--there are philosophers who\nbelieve that, in fact, the idea of free will is not incompatible with\ndeterminism. So even if determinism were true of us, that wouldn't rule\nout our having free will, because you can--appearances to the contrary\nnotwithstanding--have both determinism and free will. They're\ncompatible. Hence, this view is known as compatibilism.\n\nIf we accept compatibilism, we'll be able to say, \"Look, maybe we\nhave free will and determinism is true of us; but for all that, we're\nstill just purely physical systems.\" Even if quantum mechanics was\nwrong and somehow, you know, at the macro level all the indeterminism\nboils out--whatever--and at the macro level we are deterministic\nsystems, so what? If a deterministic system could nonetheless have free\nwill, we could still be purely physical systems. Now, mind you, I\nhaven't said anything today to convince you of the truth of\ncompatibilism, nor am I going to try to do that. My point here was only\nto say we shouldn't be so quick to think that we have to believe in the\nexistence of a soul in order to explain our having free will. It takes\nall of the premises of the argument to get the conclusion that the soul\nexists. And each one of the premises can be challenged. And here I mean\nnot merely, well, logically speaking, you know, of course you can\nreject any premise of any argument. No. I mean, there are reasonable\nphilosophical or scientific grounds for worrying about each one of the\npremises. The argument requires a lot. That doesn't prove that the\nargument fails, but it does mean that you're going to have your work\ncut out for you if you're going to use this route to arguing for the\nexistence of a soul.\n\nAll right. Let's recap. As I said, we've been considering different\nkinds of arguments for the existence of a soul, each of which appeals\nto some feature about us--our creativity, our ability to feel, the fact\nthat we have a qualitative aspect of experience, our ability to\nreason--what have you. Some fact about us that calls out for\nexplanation, and the claim on the part of the dualists was, we couldn't\nexplain it without appealing to a soul. And I've argued--I've shared\nwith you my reasons for thinking that those arguments are not\ncompelling. But notice that all of the kinds of considerations I\npointed to so far are what we might think of as everyday, familiar\nfeatures about us. It's an everyday occurrence that we can think and\nreason and feel and be creative, or choose otherwise and have free\nwill.\n\nMaybe the better arguments for the soul focus not on the everyday\nbut on the unusual, on the supernatural. Here we might then have an\nentire other family of arguments, set of arguments--again, still of the\nform \"inference to the best explanation.\" Maybe we need to posit the\nsoul in order to explain ghosts. Maybe we need to posit the soul in\norder to explain ESP; maybe we need to posit the soul in order to\nexplain near-death experiences. Maybe we need to posit the soul in\norder to explain what goes on in s√©ances or communications from the\ndead or what have you. For any one of those, we could again run an\nargument where we say, \"Look, here is something that needs explaining.\nThe best explanation appeals to the soul.\"\n\nNow, I'm going to be rather quicker in discussing this family of\narguments, but let me take at least a couple of minutes and do\nsomething about that. Take, for example, near-death experiences. This\nis something that you read a bit about in the selection from Schick and\nVaughn [Schick and Vaughn 2005, 207-323] in your course packet. The\nbasic idea was probably familiar to most of you anyway, that the\nfollowing thing happens with people who, you know, maybe their heart\ngoes into a cardiac arrest--what have you. They die on the operating\ntable, but then they're brought back to life, as we put it. And many\nsuch people, when we question them afterwards, have a very striking\nexperience. And one of the things that's striking is, how similar the\nexperience is from person to person and from culture to culture--that\nthey've got some notion, as they were dead on the operating table, of\nleaving their body. Perhaps they begin to view their body from\nup--floating up above it. Eventually, perhaps, they leave the operating\nroom altogether in this experience that they're having, and they have a\nfeeling of joy and euphoria; they have some experience of going through\na tunnel, seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. Perhaps at the\nother end of the tunnel they begin to have some communications or see\nsome loved one who has died previously or perhaps some famous religious\nperson in their--in the teaching of their tradition--their religious\ntradition. They have the sense that what they've done is basically died\nand gone to heaven. But then suddenly they get yanked back, and they\nwake up, you know, in the hospital room. So they've had near-death\nexperiences. Or perhaps a better way to put it would be they've had\ndeath experiences but then have been brought back to life.\n\nNow, there it is, right? You survey people, and people have these\nexperiences. And now we have to ask ourselves, \"What explains this?\"\nAnd here's a perfectly straightforward and natural explanation. These\npeople died. Their bodies died, and they went to the next world. They\nwent to the next life. They went to heaven but then were yanked back.\nNow, their bodies were lying there on the operating table; their bodies\nweren't in heaven. So something non-bodily went to heaven. That's how\nthe explanation goes. It's a natural, straightforward explanation of\nwhat's gone on here. Hence, inference to the best explanation. We need\nto posit the soul, something immaterial that survives the death of the\nbody, that can leave the body, go up to heaven; though, as it happens\nin these cases, the tie is never completely broken. They get yanked\nback; the soul gets yanked back by whatever cause, and reconnected to\nthe body.\n\nIt's as though we might think of there being two rooms, to use a\nkind of analogy here. There is the room that this world represents,\nthis life represents. And what happens in these experiences is that\nyour soul leaves this room and goes into a second room, the room of the\nnext world or the next life, but for various reasons, isn't allowed to\nstay in the next room. It gets yanked back to this room.\n\nWell, that's a possible explanation. And in a moment, I'll ask\nwhether it's the best possible explanation, but before we do turn to\nthat question, there is an objection to this entire way of looking at\nthings that's probably worth pausing for a moment and considering. The\nobjection is similar to the kind of dismissive attitude that we saw at\nthe beginning of the course about the question, \"Could I survive my\ndeath?\" Well, duh. Could there be life after there is no more life?\nWell, of course not.\n\nHere the objection says, this two-room notion's got to be mistaken.\nIt can't be that what's going on in near-death experiences is that\npeople are reporting about what it's like to be dead because--so the\nobjection says--they never really died. After all, 20 minutes later, or\nwhatever it is, there they are up and about. Well, not up and about;\nthey're presumably lying in their hospital beds, but they're clearly\nalive. Hence, it follows that they never really died. Or, if you want,\nyou could say maybe they died, but since they obviously didn't die\npermanently--after all they were brought back to life--how could they\npossibly tell us what it's like to be permanently dead? How can we take\ntheir experiences as veridical reports of the afterlife? Because what\nwe want to know is what is like to be permanently dead, and these\npeople were never permanently dead. So whatever unusual experiences\nthey may be having, they are not reports of the afterlife. That's how\nthe objection goes.\n\nAlthough, I think, I was pausing for a moment to raise that\nobjection, it's not an objection that I think we should take all that\nseriously. Suppose we were to agree, all right, strictly speaking these\npeople didn't die. Or strictly speaking they didn't die, certainly at\nleast, permanently. Does it follow from that that their experiences\nshould not be taken as evidence of what the afterlife is like? I think\nthat's really a misguided objection. Suppose somebody said, \"Look, I\nspent 20 years living in France, and then I came back to the United\nStates. And so I want to tell you what it's like in France.\" And\nsomebody says, \"You know, you never really moved to France permanently.\nSo your experiences in France, whatever they are--interesting as they\nmay be--can't really cast any light on what it would be like to\npermanently move to France. You'd say, \"Give me a break!\" Right? \"It's\ntrue that, of course, I didn't move to France permanently. Still, I\nhave some experience of France. And so I can--a great deal after all,\n20 years--I can give you a pretty good idea of what it's like to live\nin France, even if I didn't move there for the rest of my life without\never coming back.\" You can't say quite as much if you've only been in\nFrance for a couple of days before coming back, but still you can say\nsomething relevant.\n\nIndeed, suppose I never went into France at all. Suppose all that\nhappened was I stood right on the border and peered into France, talked\nto some people in France. They were on the French side of the border, I\nwas on the other side, but I talked to them for a while. Still, I never\nwent in, but for all that I might have something helpful to say about\nwhat it's like in France. Well, if that's the right thing to say about\nthe France case, then why not say the same thing about the near-death\nexperience case? Even if these people didn't stay in the second room,\nthey didn't stay dead, they had some experience of being dead. Isn't\nthat relevant to what it would be like to be dead? Or even if we say,\n\"No. Strictly speaking, these people didn't die at all. They were just\non the border looking in. They never, strictly speaking, died at all.\"\nSo what? They were on the border looking in. To suggest that that\ncouldn't be relevant evidence is like saying I can't tell you anything\ninteresting about what's going on in the hallway right now, because\nafter all I'm not in the hallway; I'm here in the lecture hall. So\nwhat? Even though I'm here in the lecture hall, I can see into the\nhallway and tell you what's going on in it.\n\nSo attempts to dismiss the appeal to near-death experiences on what\nwe might call philosophical grounds--this would be the bad notion of\nphilosophy--on philosophical grounds, I think that's got to be\nmisguided. Still, that doesn't mean that we should believe the argument\nfor the existence of the soul from near-death experiences, because the\nquestion remains, \"What's the best explanation of what's going on in\nnear-death experiences?\" Now, one possibility, as I suggested, was what\nI called a second ago the \"two-room explanation.\" There's the room of\nthis life, and there's the room of the next life and people who have\nnear-death experiences either temporarily were in the second room or\nelse at least they were glancing into the second room. That's one\npossible explanation. But of course, there's a different possible\nexplanation--the one-room explanation. There's just life, this life,\nand as you come very close to the wall of the room, things end up\nlooking and seeming and feeling rather different than they do in the\nmiddle of the room.\n\nNow, maybe the one-room metaphor is not the best metaphor, because\nit immediately prompts the question, \"Well, what's on the other side of\nthe wall?\" And of course, the physicalist's suggestion is there isn't\nanything on the other side of the wall. So maybe a better way to talk\nabout it would just be: Life's a biological process; we're all familiar\nwith that process, sort of, in its middle stretches. In its closing\nstretches, some fairly unusual biological processes kick in. In rare,\nbut not unheard of, cases, some people begin to have those unusual\nbiological processes and then return to the normal biological processes\nand can talk about what was happening in the unusual biological\nprocesses. Which is just to say, we need to offer a biological/physical\nexplanation of what goes on in near-death experiences.\n\nNow, mind you, that's not yet to offer the physical explanation;\nit's just a promissory note. We now have two rival explanations, the\nsoul, dualist, explanation that we went into the other world and the\nphysicalist, promissory note that we can explain the white lights and\nthe feeling of euphoria and seeing your body from a distance in\nphysical terms. We don't really have very much of a physical\nexplanation until we begin to offer scientific accounts of each of\nthose aspects of near-death experience. But this is, in fact, an area\non which scientists work. And you saw some of the beginnings of an\nexplanation offered in the reading by Schick and Vaughn. So, for\nexample, when the body is in stress, as would likely happen toward the\nend of the biological processes, when the body is in stress, certain\nendorphins get released by the body. Perhaps that explains the feelings\nof euphoria. When the body is in stress, we have various unusual\nstimulations of the visual sections of the brain, and perhaps that\nexplains the white light or the feeling of compression in the\ntunnel.\n\nNow, again, I'm not any kind of scientist and so I'm not in any\nposition to say, \"Look, here are the details of the explanation.\" But\nyou get the beginnings of that sketched in the readings, and it's a\njudgment call you've got to make. Does it seem more plausible that we\ncan explain these experiences in terms of the traumatic stress that\nyour body and brain is going through when you are near dying? Or is it\nmore plausible to suggest, \"No. What's happened here is a soul has been\nreleased from connection with the body.\" For my money, I find the\nbeginnings of the scientific explanation sufficiently persuasive and\nsufficiently compelling that I don't find the argument from near-death\nexperience--as an argument for the existence of a soul--I don't find it\nespecially persuasive.\n\nOf course, there are various other things we could appeal to in\nterms of supernatural occurrences, right? I've only mentioned--only\ndiscussed now in detail--one of them. But there are a variety of things\nabout people who can communicate from the dead or ghosts or s√©ances or\nwhat have you. And what the physicalist would need to do for each one\nof those--For each one of those you can imagine a dualist who says, \"We\nneed to believe in a soul so as to explain s√©ances. How do we explain\nthe fact that the person who's conducting the s√©ance knows things\nabout, your history that only your dead uncle would know?\" The dualist\ncan explain that by appealing to ghosts and the like.\n\nHow does the physicalist explain things like that? Short answer is,\nI don't know. I'm not the kind of person who makes it his business to\ntry to explain away those things in physicalist, naturalistic,\nmaterialistic, scientific terms. But there are people who make it their\nbusiness. So, for example, there's a magician--The question is not,\ncould I explain to you how the s√©ance manages to do the amazing things\nthat it does? You're wasting your time asking somebody like me. The\nperson to ask is a magician, somebody whose profession it is to fool\npeople and make it look like they can do things with magic. So in fact,\nthere are professional magicians who make it their business to debunk\npeople who claim to genuinely be in contact with the dead and the like.\nThere's a magician, I think his name is The Amazing Randi, who has a\nsort of standing offer; he says, \"You show me what happened in the\ns√©ance or in communication with the dead or what have you, and I'll\nshow you how to do it. I'll debunk it for you.\" Spoiler alert. And he\nhas a standing offer, he says, \"I'll pay whatever the amount is,\n$10,000 to the first person who can document some effect done in\nsupernatural terms that I can't reproduce through trickery.\" So far\nhe's never had to pay out.\n\nWell again, that doesn't prove the dualist is wrong. It could be\nthat there are genuine s√©ances. It could be that there really are\nghosts. It could be that there really is communication from the dead.\nAs is typically the case, you've got to decide for yourself what\nstrikes you as the better explanation. Is the supernatural, dualist\nexplanation the more likely one? Or is the physicalist explanation the\nmore likely one?\n\nLook, you have a dream where your dead mother has come back to talk\nto you. One possible explanation, the dualist, that's the ghost of your\nmother, immaterial soul that she is, communicating to you while you're\nasleep. Second possible explanation, it's just a dream. Of course you\ndream about your mother because your unconscious cares about her.\nWhat's the better explanation? We don't have the time here to go case,\nby case, by case, and ask ourselves, \"How does the evidence fall down\none side versus the other?\" But when I review the evidence, I come away\nthinking there's no good reason to move beyond the physical.\n\nSo again, let's recap. One group of arguments for the existence of a\nsoul says, \"We need to posit a soul in order to explain something,\nwhether it's something everyday or something supernatural.\" The\nexistence of a soul would be the beginnings of a possible explanation.\nBut the question is never, \"Is that a possible explanation?\" but, \"Is\nit the best explanation?\" And when I review these various arguments, I\ncome away thinking the better explanation falls with the physicalist.\nMind you, I don't want to deny that there are some things the\nphysicalist has not yet done a very compelling job of explaining. In\nparticular, as I've mentioned previously, I think there are mysteries\nand puzzles about the nature of consciousness, the qualitative aspect\nof experience, what it's like to smell coffee or taste pineapple or see\nred. It's very hard to see how you explain that in physicalist terms.\nSo to that extent, I think we can say the jury may still be out. But I\ndon't think what we should say is, \"The better explanation lies with\nthe dualist.\" Because I think positing a soul doesn't really yet offer\nus the explanation. It just holds out the promise of an explanation. So\nat best that's a tie, and hence, no compelling reason to accept the\nexistence of a soul.\n\nIt would be one thing if we could see that no conceivable\nphysicalist explanation could possibly work. But I don't think we're in\nthat situation. All we're in right now is, perhaps in existence of that\nwith regard to consciousness, maybe some other things, we don't yet see\nhow to explain it. But not yet seeing how to explain it is not the same\nthing as seeing that it can't be explained on physicalist terms. Of\ncourse, again, if we had a dualist explanation with some details really\nworked out, maybe we'd have to say, \"Look, this is the better\nexplanation.\" But dualism doesn't so much offer the explanation\ntypically as just say, \"Well, maybe we'd be better off positing\nsomething immaterial.\" That, I think, is not a very compelling\nargument.\n\nWell, let's ask. What other kinds of arguments could be offered for\nthe existence of a soul? I want to emphasize the point that the various\narguments that I have been talking about so far, although they have\nthis common strand--\"inference to the best explanation\"--are each\nseparate and distinct arguments. One of them might work even though the\nother ones don't work. But I want to turn now to a rather different\nkind of argument.\n\nThe argument I'm about to sketch is a purely philosophical argument,\nnot really so much a matter of who can explain this or that feature of\nus better than anybody else. It's an argument that doesn't seem to have\nany empirical premises; it works from purely armchair philosophical\nreflection. And the striking thing is that many people find this a\npretty compelling argument. The argument I'm going to give traces back\nto Descartes, the great early modern philosopher. Well, I'm not going\nto follow the details of this argument, but the basic idea goes back to\nDescartes. And it starts by asking you to imagine a story.\n\nSo I'm going to tell the story in the first person. I'm going to\ntell about myself, but you know, you'll find the argument sort of,\nperhaps more persuasive if, as I tell the story, you imagine the story\nbeing told about you. So each one of you should translate this into a\nstory about yourself. You know, your morning. So this is a story about\nmy morning. Imagine--this didn't, of course, actually happen, but\nimagine--the crucial point here is simply that we can imagine this\nstory happening, not even that we think it's empirically possible, just\nit's conceivable, it's an imaginable story. All right.\n\nSo suppose that I woke up this morning, that is to say, at a certain\npoint I look around my room and I see the familiar sights of my\ndarkened bedroom. I hear, perhaps, the sounds of the cars outside my\nhouse, my alarm clock ringing, what have you. I move out of the room\ntoward the bathroom, planning to brush my teeth. As I enter the\nbathroom, it's much more light, I look in the mirror and--here's where\nthings get really weird--I don't see anything. Normally, of course,\nwhen I look in the mirror I see my face. I see my head; I see the\nreflection of my torso. But now, as I'm looking into the mirror, I\ndon't see anything at all. Instead, I see the shower reflected behind\nme. Normally, that's blocked of course by me, by my body. But I don't\nsee my body. Slightly freaked out, I reach for my head, or perhaps we\nshould say I reach for where I would expect my head to be, but I don't\nfeel anything there. Glancing down at my arms, I don't see any arms.\nNow, I'm really panicking. As I begin trying to touch my body, I don't\nfeel anything. I don't--Not only can't I feel anything with my fingers,\nI don't have any sensations where my body should be.\n\nNow, we could continue this story, but I've probably said enough for\nyou to grant that what I've just started doing--a novelist could do a\nbetter job of telling the story than I just did--but what I've just\ndone was basically imagine--I've imagined a story in which I discover\nthat my body doesn't exist. Or I've imagined a story in which my body\nhas perhaps ceased to exist, or I've imagined a story in which I exist,\nor at least my mind exists. You know, I'm thinking thoughts like, \"Why\ncan't I see my body in the mirror? Why can't I feel my head? What's\ngoing on?\" I'm panicking, right? We've got a story in which I'm\nthinking all sorts of thoughts; my mind clearly exists, and yet, for\nall that, my body does not exist. We could--certainly it seems--imagine\nthat possibility. Now, the brilliant thing about this argument is it\ngoes from that to a conclusion about there being a difference between\nmy mind and my body.\n\nWhat we've just done, after all, is imagine that my mind exists but\nmy body does not. Now, what does that show? Descartes says what it\nshows is the mind and the body must be two logically distinct things.\nThe mind and the body cannot be the same thing. Because, after all,\nwhat I just did was imagine my mind existing without my body. How could\nI even do that, even in imagination? How could it even be possible to\nimagine my mind without my body, if talking about my mind is just a way\nof talking about my body? If they're really, bottom line,\nmetaphysically speaking, the same thing, then you couldn't have one\nwithout the other after all. So here's a podium. Try to tell a story in\nwhich this podium exists but this podium does not exist. You can't do\nit, right? The podium is just one thing, the podium. And if it is just\none thing, you could tell a story in which it exists; you could tell a\nstory in which it doesn't exist. But you can't tell a story in which it\nexists and doesn't exist.\n\nIf I can tell a story in which A exists and B doesn't exist, it's\ngot to follow that A and B are not the same thing. Because if B was\njust another word for, another way of talking about, A, then to imagine\nA existing but B not existing would be imagining A existing but--well,\nB is just A--A not existing. But of course, you can't imagine a world\nin which A exists but A doesn't exist. Put the same point the other way\naround: If I can imagine A without B, then A and B have to be logically\ndistinct things. They cannot be identical. But since I can imagine my\nmind existing without my body, it follows that my mind and my body have\nto be logically distinct things. They cannot be identical. My mind\ncannot just be a way of talking. Talking about my mind cannot just be a\nway of talking about my body.\n\nNow, it's a very cool argument. You know, philosophers love this\nargument. And I've got to tell you, to this day there's a debate in the\nphilosophical community about whether or not this argument works. It's\none thing to be clear--a couple of things to be clear about. What\nexactly is this argument not doing? The argument is not saying, \"If\nsomething is possible, if I can imagine it, it's true.\" No. I can\nimagine unicorns. It doesn't mean unicorns exist. That's not what the\nargument is saying. The argument is only making a much more specific\nclaim. If I can imagine one thing without the other, they must be\nseparate things. Now, of course, it could still be that in the real\nworld the one thing cannot exist without the other. There may be some\nsort of metaphysical laws that tie the two things so tightly together\nthat you'll never actually get one without the other. That's not the\nquestion. The point is just if I can at least imagine the one thing\nwithout the other, they must in fact be two separate things. Because if\nthere was really just one thing there, you couldn't imagine it without\nit. Since I can imagine my mind without my body, it must be the case\nthat my mind is something separate and distinct from my body.\nOtherwise, how could I imagine it existing without the body? If they\nwere the same thing, I couldn't--I can't imagine the body existing\nwithout the body. If the mind is just a way of talking about the body,\nhow could I imagine the mind without the body? Since I can imagine the\nmind without the body, it follows that they're separate. So the mind is\nnot the body after all. It's something different. It's the soul.\n\nIs that a good argument or not? That's where we'll start next\ntime.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n---\n\nReferences\n\nSchick, Theodore and Lewis Vaughn. \"Near-Death Experiences.\" In\nHow to Think About Weird Things.

What the argument attempts to show is that this mind must be\nsomething separate from my body. And what's amazing about the argument\nis that it works on the basis of a pure thought experiment. The thought\nexperiment, you recall, was one in which I imagine, I tell myself a\nstory in which what I'm doing is I'm imagining my mind existing without\nmy body. It doesn't seem especially difficult to do that. But then, we\nadd this extra philosophical premise. If I can imagine one thing\nwithout the other, then it must be that those are two things. So my\nmind must not be my body. My mind must not be the same thing as my body\nor a way of talking about my body, because of course if my mind just\nwas--talking about my mind just was--a way of talking about my body,\nthen to try to imagine my mind without my body would be trying to\nimagine my body without my body. And that, obviously, can't happen.\n\nLook. Suppose we try to imagine a world in which Shelly exists but\nKagan doesn't. You can't, right? Because of course, they're just a\nsingle thing, Shelly Kagan. And so if you've imagined Shelly existing\nthen of course you're imagining that single thing, Shelly Kagan,\nexisting. And if you imagine Kagan not existing, then you're imagining\nthat single thing, Shelly Kagan, not existing. So you can't even\nimagine a world in which Shelly exists but Kagan doesn't.\n\nNow, it's important not to be confused about this. We can easily\nimagine a world in which I don't have the last name Kagan or perhaps to\nswitch it around, Shelly's not my name. Suppose my parents had named me\nBruce. Nothing would be easier. Imagine a world in which Kagan exists,\nbut Shelly doesn't exist, because nobody in the world is named\nShelly.\n\nThe question is not, \"Can you imagine me with a different name?\"\nBruce instead of Shelly, easy enough. It's rather, \"Can you imagine a\nworld in which the very thing that you really are picking out when you\nrefer to me by the name Shelly--namely this thing--can you imagine a\nworld in which that thing exists, but the thing that you're picking up\nwhen you use the word Kagan does not exist?\" And that you can't do,\nbecause in the real world of course Shelly and Kagan pick out just two\ndifferent names of this very same thing. This thing right here. So\nimagining a world in which Shelly exists but Kagan doesn't or Kagan\nexists but Shelly doesn't, that's trying to imagine a world in which I\nexist but I don't. And that's, of course, incoherent.\n\nSo if you can--On the other hand, contrast. Can I imagine a world in\nwhich my left hand exists, but my right hand doesn't? Easy. Why is it\nso easy? Because of course there's two different things. Of course,\nthat doesn't mean that in the real world one of them does exist and the\nother one doesn't. But it does show that in the real world they are two\ndifferent things. That's why I could imagine a world with one but not\nthe other. Try to imagine a world in which somebody's smile exists but\ntheir body doesn't. You can't do it. You can't have the smile without\nthe body. And of course, no mystery about that. That's because the\nsmile isn't really some separate thing from the body. Talking about\nsmiles, as we've noted before, is just a way of talking about either\nwhat the body can do or what a certain area of the body can do.\n\nYou can try to imagine it. In Alice in Wonderland, the\nCheshire Cat disappears and all we have left, the last thing that\ndisappears, is the smile. But of course, when you imagine the Cheshire\nCat only having the smile there, you're still imagining the cat's lips,\nteeth, maybe tongue, whatever it is. If you try to imagine a smile with\nno body at all, it can't be done. Why? Because the smile isn't\nsomething separate from the body.\n\n\"Try to imagine my mind,\" says Descartes, \"without my body.\" Easy.\nFrom which it follows that my mind and my body must not be one thing.\nThey must, in fact, be two things. That's why it's possible to imagine\nthe one without the other.\n\nSo this Cartesian argument seems to show us that the mind is\nsomething separate from, distinct from, not reducible to, not just a\nway of talking about, my body. So it's got to be something extra above\nand beyond my body. It's a soul. That's what Descartes argued. And as I\nsay, to this day, philosophers disagree about whether this argument\nworks or not. I don't think it does work and in a second I'll give you\na counter example. And then, having given the counter example‚Ä¶ That is\nto say, what I'm going to give is an example of an argument just like\nit, or at least an argument that seems to be just like it where we can\npretty easily see that that argument doesn't work. And so something\nmust go wrong with Descartes' argument as well.\n\nWell, here's the counter example. Some of you, I'm sure most of you,\nmaybe all of you, are familiar with the Evening Star. The Evening Star\nis the, roughly speaking, first heavenly body that's visible in the sky\nas it gets dark, at least at certain times of the year. And I'm sure\nyou're also familiar then with the Morning Star. The Morning Star is\nthat heavenly body which is the last heavenly body that's still visible\nas dawn comes in and it begins to get light. So as a first pass, the\nEvening Star is the first star that's visible and the Morning Star is\nthe last star that's visible at the right times of the year. The world\nthat we live in has both the Evening Star and the Morning Star. But try\nto imagine a world in which the Evening Star exists, but the Morning\nStar does not. Seems fairly straightforward, right? I get up in the\nmorning as dawn's approaching. I look around and the Morning Star is\nnot there. There is no star where the Morning Star had been or where\npeople have claimed it would be or something. But the Evening Star\nstill exists. When I go out as sun sets and dusk falls, there is the\nEvening Star.\n\nSo, as I say, it's a trivial matter to imagine a world in which the\nEvening Star exists and the Morning Star does not. And so we've got\na--we could imagine then a--Descartes-like argument saying, \"If I can\nimagine the Evening Star without the Morning Star, that shows the\nEvening Star and the Morning Star must be two different heavenly\nbodies.\" But in fact, that's not so. The Evening Star and the Morning\nStar are the very same heavenly body. In fact, it's not a star at all.\nIt's a planet. It's Venus, if I recall correctly. So look, there's only\none thing. The Evening Star is Venus. The Morning Star is Venus. So\nthere couldn't be a world in which the Evening Star exists, but the\nMorning Star doesn't, because that would be a world in which Venus\nexists and Venus doesn't exist. Obviously, that's not possible.\n\nOf course what you can imagine is a world in which Venus isn't\nvisible in the morning. Still, that's not a world in which the Morning\nStar doesn't exist, given that what we mean by the Morning Star is that\nheavenly object, whatever it is, that in this world we pick out at that\ntime in the morning looking up at the sky. So when I refer to the\nMorning Star, I'm talking about Venus, whether or not I realize it's\nVenus. When I talk about the Evening Star, I'm referring to Venus,\nwhether or not I realize that Venus is the Evening Star. So as long as\nVenus is around, well, there's the Evening Star, there's the Morning\nStar, there's Venus. You can't have a world in which the Morning Star\ndoesn't exist but the Evening Star does. Although you could have a\nworld in which Venus doesn't show up in the morning. Still, from the\nfact that I can imagine the world in which I look around for the\nMorning Star--there it isn't. I look around for the Evening Star--there\nit is. You might have thought that showed--didn't Descartes prove to us\nthat that shows--the Evening Star and the Morning Star are two\ndifferent things? Well no, obviously it didn't. So let's think about\nwhat that means.\n\nSo we've got this argument that Descartes puts forward. I can\nimagine my mind without my body. And Descartes says that shows that, in\nfact, my mind is something separate from my body. Well, I can imagine\nthe Evening Star without the Morning Star, so Son of Descartes,\n\"Descarteson,\" has to say, \"Oh, so that shows that the Morning Star and\nthe Evening Star are two different things.\" But \"Descarteson\" would be\nwrong when he says that. The Morning Star and the Evening Star aren't\ntwo different things. They're just one thing, namely Venus. In fact,\nthe sentence, \"They are one thing,\" is slightly misleading,\nright? It's just one thing, Venus. If that argument, if the\nargument--If trying to run the Cartesian argument for astronomy fails,\nyet it seems to be an exactly analogous argument, we ought to conclude\nthat the argument for the distinctness of the mind and the body must\nfail as well.\n\nNow, that seems to me to be right. I think the Cartesian argument\ndoes fail. And I think the example of the Evening Star and the Morning\nStar--which is not at all original to me--that this example shows, this\ncounter example shows, that Descartes' original argument doesn't work\neither. At least, that's how it seems to me, though as I say, there are\nphilosophers that say, \"No, no. That's not right. Maybe somehow we\nmisunderstood how the argument goes and it doesn't exactly--although\nthese two arguments seem parallel, they're not, in fact, parallel.\nThere's some subtle differences that if we're not looking carefully,\nwe'll overlook.\" But, as I say, the debate goes on. One of the reasons\nfor thinking it's not clear whether the argument fails or not is\nbecause it's hard to pin down, where exactly did it go wrong?\n\nLook, take the argument of the planets, the Morning Star and the\nEvening Star example. I take it that we all agree that when we attempt\nto run the Cartesian argument in terms of the Morning Star and the\nEvening Star, it fails. But it's harder to say what went wrong? How did\nit go wrong? Why did it go wrong?\n\nWhat are the possibilities? Well, we said, look, first claim, first\npremise. I can imagine a world in which the Evening Star exists, but\nthe Morning Star doesn't. Well, I suppose one possible response would\nbe, \"You know, you couldn't really do that. You thought you were\nimagining a world in which the Evening Star exists and the Morning Star\ndoesn't, but you weren't really imagining a world in which the Evening\nStar exists and the Morning Star doesn't. You misdescribed what it is\nyou've imagined.\" That's not a silly thing to say about the astronomy\ncase. Maybe that's the right diagnosis.\n\nCould we similarly say, \"I didn't really imagine a world in which my\nmind exists but my body doesn't\"? That little story I told last time, I\nthought I was describing a world in which my mind exists and my body\ndoesn't, but it wasn't really imagining a world like that. That doesn't\nseem so persuasive over there. It did seem as though I was imagining\nit.\n\nWhat else could go wrong with the astronomy example? Well, maybe I\ndid imagine a world in which the Morning Star exists and the Evening\nStar doesn't exist, but maybe imagining doesn't mean it's possible.\nNormally, we think, if we imagine something, it means it's possible.\nHere I don't mean, of course, empirically possible. I could imagine a\nworld with unicorns. It doesn't mean I think unicorns are physically\npossible. All we mean here is logically possible. I can imagine a world\nwith unicorns. It seems to follow that unicorns are logically possible.\nImagination seems to be a guide to possibility; but maybe not always.\nMaybe sometimes we can imagine something that's really impossible. Try\nto imagine--can you do that or can you not do that?--try to imagine a\nround square. Can you imagine it? Can you not imagine it? In certain\nmoods, I sort of feel I can just begin to imagine it. Of course, it\ndoesn't really mean it's possible. It seems like it's impossible. So\nmaybe imagination is a flawed guide to possibility. So maybe that's\nwhat we should say about the mind-body case. \"Yeah, I can imagine a\nworld in which my mind exists but my body doesn't. But that doesn't\nshow that it's really possible, logically possible to have a world in\nwhich my mind exists and my body doesn't.\" Maybe that's where the\nargument goes wrong. On the other hand, isn't imagination our best\nguide to logical possibility? Isn't the reason I think unicorns are\nlogically coherent is because I can imagine them so easily?\n\nAnother possibility. Maybe we should say, the mere fact that it's\npossible for A and B to be separate--for A to exist without B for\nexample, that's clearly where they're separate--the mere fact that it's\npossible for them to be separate doesn't mean that in the actual world\nthey are separate. Maybe the argument goes wrong by assuming that\nidentity--when A is equal to B, it's always equal to B, no matter what.\nMaybe identity, as philosophers like to put it, maybe identity is\ncontingent. Maybe A could be the same thing as B in this logically\npossible world, but we could imagine a completely different logically\ncoherent world in which A was not the same thing as B. If that's right,\nthen maybe the conclusion should be \"well, you know, yeah, the\nCartesian thought experiment shows that there could be a world in which\nthere are minds that are not identical to bodies. But that doesn't mean\nthat in this world the mind is not identical to my body. Maybe in this\nworld, minds and bodies are identical, even though in other logically\npossible worlds the identity comes apart. Identity is not necessary,\nbut contingent, as the philosophers put it.\"\n\nIt's not clear that that's right either. The notion of contingent\nidentity is very puzzling. After all, if A really is B, how could they\ncome apart? There's only one thing there. There's nothing to come\napart. There's just A equals B, that single thing. What's to come\napart?\n\nSo where exactly does the argument break down? Is it that I'm not\nreally imagining? I'm just thinking I'm imagining? Is it that\nimagination's not really a good guide to possibility? I just--Often it\nis, but not always. Is it that identity is contingent? The interesting\nthing about Descartes' argument is that it's easy to see something has\ngone wrong in the case of the Morning Star and the Evening Star, but\nit's difficult to pin down what exactly went wrong. Different\nphilosophers agree that something's gone wrong in the Morning Star and\nthe Evening Star case, but disagree about the best diagnosis of where\nthe mistake went in. Armed with your pet diagnosis of where the\nargument goes wrong there, you've got to ask, \"Does it also go wrong in\nthe mind and body case?\"\n\nWell, we could spend more time, but I'm not going to. I think\nDescartes' argument fails. I think the Morning Star, Evening Star case\nshows us that arguments like this, at the very least, can't be taken at\nface value. Just because it looks as though we can imagine it and just\nbecause it seems as though from the fact that we can imagine one\nwithout the other, it just won't necessarily follow that we really do\nhave two things that are separate and not identical in the real world.\nI'd be happy to discuss with you, outside class, at greater length my\nfavorite theories as to where the argument goes wrong and why I think\nit goes wrong in Descartes' case as well. But I suggest that the\nargument goes wrong. It's not right. And so, Descartes' attempt to\nestablish the distinctness of the mind, the immateriality of the mind,\non the basis of this Cartesian thought experiment, I think that's\nunsuccessful.\n\nWell, we've spent--Let's step back and think of where we've been.\nWe've spent the last week and a half or so, maybe a bit more, two\nweeks, talking about arguments for the existence of the soul. And\nunsurprisingly--since I announced this was going to be the result\nbefore the class had barely gotten started--I don't think any of these\narguments work. I believe the attempts to establish the existence of a\nsoul, an immaterial object, the house of consciousness separate and\ndistinct from the body, I think those arguments fail. But I recognize\nthat this is something that reasonable people can disagree about. And\nso this is, as will be many times the case over the course of this\nsemester, something that I invite you to continue to reflect on for\nyourself. If you believe in a soul, what's the argument for it?\n\nWell, what we're about to turn to is Plato's discussion of these\nissues in the dialogue the Phaedo, which, as I told you last\nweek, purports to lay out the final day's discussion with Socrates\nbefore he is killed by--he kills himself--by drinking the hemlock in\naccordance with the punishment that's been given to him. Now, in the\ncourse of this discussion, Socrates and his disciples argue about not\nso much the existence of the soul, but the question really is the\nimmortality of the soul. After all, even if you believe in a soul, as I\nhave remarked previously, that doesn't give us yet any reason to\nbelieve the soul continues to exist after the death of your body. The\nkind of dualist position that we are considering in this class is an\ninteractionist position, where the soul commands the body. That's what\nmakes my fingers move right now. And the body can affect the soul. If I\npoke my body, I feel it in my mind. So the mind, the soul, and the body\nare obviously very tightly connected. And so it could be--even if the\nsoul is something separate from the body--that when the body dies, the\nsoul dies as well. That's the question that's driving the discussion in\nthe Phaedo.\n\nDo we have any good reason to believe the soul survives the death of\nthe body? And more particularly still, do we have good reason to\nbelieve it's immortal? Socrates believes in the immortality of the\nsoul. And so, he attempts to defend this position, justify it to his\ndisciples who are worried that it may not be true. It's important to\nrealize--as you read the dialogue, it becomes fairly apparent--that\nthere isn't so much any defense of the belief in the soul. There's some\nof it, but it's not the primary goal. For the most part, the existence\nof the soul is just taken for granted in the dialogue. Plato, as a\ndualist, portrays Socrates as being a dualist and that's just taken for\ngranted. The question that the philosophical discussion turns on is\nnot, \"Is there a soul?\" but rather, \"Does it survive the death of the\nbody? Is it immortal?\"\n\nNow, as I said, this is Socrates' last day on earth and you'd expect\nhim to be pretty bummed. You'd expect him to be sad. And one of the\njust striking things is that Socrates is in a very happy, indeed\njovial, mood, joking with his friends. Why is that? Well, of course,\nit's because he thinks, first of all, there's a soul and it will\nsurvive and it's immortal. But more importantly still--those are all\ncrucial but there's an extra ingredient as well--he thinks he's got\ngood reason to believe, when he dies he's going to go, basically, to\nwhat we'd call heaven. He thinks there's a realm populated by good gods\nand maybe other philosophical kindred souls. And if you got your stuff\ntogether here on life, you'll get to go to that when you die. And so\nhe's excited. He's pleased.\n\nWhy does he think he's going to go? Well, in thinking about\nSocrates' belief in the existence of a soul, it's important to\nunderstand, it's important to notice, that his take on which stuff gets\nassigned to the body, what are the bodily things versus what are the\nsoul-like things, is rather different from the way, I think, most of us\nnowadays would draw the line. When I talked about arguments for the\nexistence of a soul, I said, \"Look, here's one possible argument. I see\ncolors. No physical object could, no purely physical object could see\ncolors. I can taste tastes and have the smell of coffee and so forth.\"\nBut Socrates thinks all those bodily sensations--that's all stuff that\nthe body takes care of. So unlike those modern dualists who think we\nneed to appeal to something immaterial in order to explain bodily\nsensations, Socrates thinks no, no, the body takes care of all the\nbodily sensations, all the desirings and the wantings and the emotions\nand the feelings and the cravings. That's all body stuff.\n\nWhat the soul does--Socrates thinks--the soul thinks. The soul, in\nits essence, is rational. It takes care of the thinking side of things.\nWhat does the soul think about? Well, the soul thinks about all sorts\nof things, doubtless. But one of the things that it can do, one of the\nthings that sort of provides the underpinnings, as we'll see, for\nPlato's arguments for the immortality of the soul is the soul can think\nabout--;well, here I'll have to introduce a word of philosophical\njargon. Sometimes the idea, sometimes the term is called \"ideas.\"\nSometimes the term is called \"forms.\" But the thought is that the soul\ncan think about certain pure concepts or ideas like justice itself, or\nbeauty itself, or goodness itself, or health itself. So to explain all\nthis we need now a sort of crash course in Plato's metaphysics.\nObviously, this will be rather superficial. Those of you who would like\nto know more about it, I recommend reading more Platonic dialogues or\ntaking a class in ancient philosophy. But here's the basic idea.\n\nThere's all sorts of beautiful objects in the world. Objects can\nvary in terms of how beautiful they are. But Plato's got the idea that\nthere's nothing in this world that's perfectly beautiful. And yet for\nall that, we can think about beauty itself. Well, we might put it this\nway. We might say, ordinary, humdrum, everyday, physical objects are\nsomewhat beautiful. They're partially beautiful. As, sometimes,\nPlatonists put it, they \"participate\" in beauty. They partake of beauty\nto varying degrees. But none of them should be confused with beauty\nitself. Or, take justice. There are various arrangements, social\narrangements, that can be just or unjust to varying degrees. But we\ndon't think anywhere in the world there's any society that's perfectly\njust. Yet for all that, the mind can think about perfect justice. And\nnotice how ordinary empirical social arrangements fall short of perfect\njustice. So whatever perfect justice is, it's not one more thing in the\nempirical world. It's something we can think about. It's something that\nthings in the empirical world can participate in or partake of to\nvarying degrees. But we shouldn't confuse the physical things which can\nbe just, the people who can be virtuous to one degree or another, with\nperfect virtue or perfect justice. That's something that only the mind\ncan think about, that we don't actually have in the world, the\nempirical world itself.\n\nOr take being round. The mind can think about perfect circularity.\nBut no physical object is perfectly circular. There are only things\nthat are circular to a greater or lesser degree. So, by thinking about\nit, by thinking about these kinds of issues, we can see that the mind\nhas some kind of handle on these perfect, well, we need a word. And as\nI say, Plato gives us a word, \"ideas.\" Sometimes it's translated as\n\"ideas\" or \"forms.\" These things that we can think about that are the\ntemplate, or at least the standard, or maybe at the very least it's\nthat which the ordinary humdrum things can participate in to varying\ndegrees: perfect justice, justice itself, beauty itself, goodness\nitself, circularity itself, health itself. All of these things are, as\nphilosophers nowadays call them, Platonic forms. Ordinary material\nobjects of this world can partake of the various Platonic forms, but\nthey should not be confused with the Platonic forms. But we still--even\nthough we don't bump into the Platonic forms in this world--we can\nthink about them. Our mind has a kind of grasp of them.\n\nOf course, the problem is, we're distracted by the comings and\ngoings, the hurly burly of the ordinary everyday world. And so we don't\nhave a very good grasp of the Platonic forms. We're able to think about\nthem, but we're distracted. What the philosopher tries to do--this is\nSocrates' thought, or Plato's thought that he puts in Socrates'\nmouth--what the philosopher tries to do is free himself from the\ndistractions that the body poses--the desire for food, the craving for\nsex, being concerned about pain. All this stuff, hungering after\npleasure, all this stuff gets in the way of thinking about the Platonic\nforms. What the philosopher tries to do, then, so as to better focus on\nthese ideal things, is to disregard the body, put it aside, separate\nhis mind as much as possible from it. That's what Socrates says he's\nbeen trying to do. And so because of that, he's got a better handle on\nthese ideal forms. And then, he believes, when death comes and the\nfinal separation occurs of the mind and the body, his mind gets to go\nup, his soul gets to go up to this heavenly realm. Philosophers\nnowadays call it \"Plato's heaven.\" He gets to go up to Plato's heaven\nwhere he can have more direct contact with these things, with the\nforms.\n\nNow, I don't have the time here to say enough to try and make it\nclear why this Platonic metaphysical view is a view that not only is\nworth taking seriously, but to this day, many, many philosophers think\nthat, at least in it's basic strokes, must be right. But let me at\nleast give you one example that may give you a feel for it. Think of\nmath. Think of some simple mathematical claim like 2 + 2 = 4. When we\nsay that 2 + 2 = 4 or 2 + 3 = 5, we're saying something about numbers\nthat our mind is able to grasp. But what are numbers anyway? They're\ncertainly not physical objects. It's not as though someday you're going\nto open up an issue of National Geographic where the cover\nstory's going to be \"At long last, explorers have discovered the number\ntwo.\" It's not as though the number two is something that you see or\nhear or taste or could bump into. Whatever the number two is, it's\nsomething that our mind can grasp but isn't actually in the physical\nworld.\n\nThat's the Platonic take on mathematics. There are numbers. The mind\ncan think about them. Things can partake of them. If I were to hold up\ntwo pieces of paper, there's a sense in which they are participating in\n\"twohood.\" But of course, this is not the number two here. If I were to\nrip these pieces of paper, I wouldn't be destroying the number two. So\nthe number two, the numbers, three, whatever it is, whatever they are,\nare these Platonic abstract entities that don't exist in space and\ntime. Yet, for all that, the mind can think about them. That's the\nidea. And it's not a silly idea. It seems like a very compelling\naccount of what's going on in mathematics. What mathematicians are\ndoing is using their mind to think about these Platonic ideas of\nmathematics. Except Plato's thought was, everything is like that. It's\nnot just math, but justice itself is like that. There are just or\nunjust things in the world. The mind can think about them, but justice\nitself--this perfect, this idea of being perfectly just--that's\nsomething the mind can think about, but it's not here in the world.\nIt's another abstract Platonic form.\n\nSo that's the picture. Plato's idea is that if we start doing enough\nmetaphysics, we can see there must be this realm of Platonic ideas,\nPlatonic forms. And we can see that we are able to grasp them through\nthe mind. This can't be a job the body does, because the body's only\ngot its bodily capacities, right? It's able to do the five-senses\nthing. It's the soul that thinks about the Platonic forms. And as\nPlato's then going to go on to try to argue, given this picture of what\nthe mind can do, he thinks he can persuade us that the mind, the soul,\nnot only survives the death of your body, but will last forever. It's\nperfect. It's immaterial and can't be destroyed. It's immortal. So he\noffers a series of arguments for that conclusion, for that position,\nand starting next time, we'll work our way through those arguments.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct07.html":{"url":"lct07.html","title":"Lecture 7","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 7 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 6, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: We've begun to turn to Plato's\ndialogue Phaedo, and what I started doing last time was\nsketching the basic outlines of Plato's metaphysics--not so much to\ngive a full investigation of that--clearly we're not going to do that\nhere--but just to provide enough of the essential outlines of Plato's\nmetaphysical views so that we can understand the arguments that come up\nlater in the Phaedo, basically all of which or many of which\npresuppose something--certain central aspects about Plato's\nmetaphysical views.\n\nThe key point behind his metaphysics then was the thought that, in\naddition to the ordinary empirical physical world that we're all\nfamiliar with, we have to posit the existence of a kind of second\nrealm, in which exist the Platonic--as they're nowadays called--the\nPlatonic forms or Platonic ideas. The sort of thing that perhaps we\nmight call or think of as abstract objects or abstract properties. And\nthe reason for positing these things is because we're clearly able to\nthink about these ideas, and yet, we recognize that the ordinary\nphysical world--although things may participate in them to varying\ndegrees--we don't actually come across these objects or entities in the\nphysical world. So that we can talk about things being beautiful to\nvarying degrees, but we never come across beauty itself in the actual\nempirical world. We are able to talk about the fact that two plus one\nequals three, but it's not as though we ever come across\nnumbers--number three itself--anywhere in the empirical world.\n\nA further point that distinguishes the empirical world from\nthis--this realm of Platonic ideal objects--is that indeed\nthey--there's something perfect about them. They don't change. In\ncontrast, physical objects are constantly changing. Something might be\nshort at one point and become tall at another point, ugly at one point\nand become beautiful--like the ugly duckling. It starts out ugly and\nbecomes a beautiful swan. In contrast, justice itself never changes.\nBeauty itself never changes. We have the thought that these things are\neternal, and indeed, beyond change, in contrast to the empirical world.\nIn fact, if you start thinking more about the world from this\nperspective, the world we live in is crazy. It's almost insanely\ncontradictory.\n\nPlato thinks of it as crazy in the way that a dream is. When you're\ncaught up in the dream, you don't notice just how insane it all is. But\nif you step back and reflect on it, \"Well, let's see, I was eating a\nsandwich and suddenly the sandwich was the Statue of Liberty, except\nthe Statue of Liberty was my mother. And she's flying over the ocean,\nexcept she's really a piece of spaghetti.\" That's how dreams are. And\nwhen you're in it, it sort of all makes sense. Right? You're kind of\ncaught up, but you step back and say, \"That's just insane.\" Well, Plato\nthinks that the empirical world has something of that kind of insanity,\nsomething of that kind contradictoriness, built into it that we don't\nordinarily notice. \"He's a basketball player, so he's really, really\ntall, except he's only six feet. So he's really, really short for a\nbasketball player. This is a baby elephant, so it's really, really\nbig--except it's a baby elephant, so it's really, really small.\"\n\nThe world is constantly rolling--this is a Platonic\nexpression--rolling between one form and the other. And it's hard to\nmake sense of. In contrast, the mind is able to grasp the Platonic\nideas, the Platonic forms; and they're stable, they're reliable, they\nare--they're law-like and we can grasp them. They don't change; they're\neternal. That's, as I say, the Platonic picture.\n\nNow, it's not my purpose here to try to argue for or against\nPlatonism with regard to abstract entities. As I suggested in talking\nabout the example of math last time, it's not a silly view, even if\nit's not a view that we all take automatically. But in thinking about\nmath, most of us are inclined to be Platonists. We all do believe\nsomething makes it true that two plus one equals three, but it's not\nthe fact that empirical objects--We don't do empirical experiments to\nsee whether two plus one equals three. Rather, we think our mind can\ngrasp the truths about numbers. Plato thought everything was like that.\nWell, I'm not going to argue for and against that view--just wanted to\nsketch it, so as to understand the arguments that turn on it.\n\nSo for our purposes, let's suppose Plato was right about that and\nask, what follows? Well, Plato thinks what's going to follow is that we\nhave some reason to believe in the immortality of the soul as, again,\nas we indicated last time, the picture is that the mind--the soul--is\nable to grasp these eternal Platonic forms, the ideas. Typically, we're\ndistracted from thinking about them by the distractions provided by the\nbody--the desire for food, drink, sex, what have you, sleep. But by\ndistancing itself from the body, the mind, the soul, is able to better\nconcentrate on the forms. And if you're good at that, if you practice\nwhile you're alive, separating yourself from the body, then when your\nbody dies, the mind is able to go up to this Platonic heavenly realm\nand commune with gods and other immortal souls and think about the\nforms. But if you've not separated yourself from the body while in\nlife, if you're too enmeshed in its concerns, then upon the death of\nyour body your soul will get sucked back in, reincarnated perhaps, in\nanother body. If you're lucky, as another person; if you're not so\nlucky, as a pig or a donkey or an ant or what have you.\n\nSo your goal, Plato says, your goal should be, in life, to practice\ndeath--to separate yourself from your body. And because of this,\nSocrates, who's facing death, isn't distressed at the prospect, but\nhappy. He's happy that the final separation will take place and he'll\nbe able to go to heaven.\n\nThe dialogue ends, of course, with the death scene--Socrates has\nbeen condemned to death by the Athenians, and it ends with his drinking\nthe hemlock, not distressed but rather sort of joyful. And the dialogue\nends with one of the great moving death scenes in western civilization\nand as Plato says--let's get the quote here exactly right--\"Of all\nthose we have known, he was the best and also the wisest and the most\nupright.\"\n\nJust before the death scene, there's a long myth, which I draw your\nattention to but I don't want to discuss in any kind of detail. Plato\nsays it's a story; it's a myth. He's trying to indicate that there are\nthings that we can't really know in a scientific way but we can\nglimpse. And the myth has to do with these sort of pictures I was just\ndescribing where we don't actually live on the surface of the Earth of\nin the light, but rather live in certain hollows in the dark where\nwe're mistaken about the nature of reality. Some of you who are maybe\nfamiliar with Plato's later dialogue The Republic may recognize\nat least what seems to me, what we have here, is a foreshadowing of the\nmyth of the cave, or the allegory of the cave, which Plato describes\nthere as well.\n\nOur concern is going to be the arguments that make up the center of\nthe dialogue. Because in the center of the dialogue, before he dies,\nSocrates is arguing with his friends. Socrates is saying, \"Look, I'm\nnot worried. I'm going to live forever.\" And his disciples and friends\nare worried whether this is true or not. And so the heart of the\ndialogue consists of a series of arguments in which Socrates attempts\nto lay out his reasons for believing in the immortality of the soul.\nAnd that's going to be our concern. What I'm going to do is basically\nrun through my attempt to reconstruct--my attempt to lay out the basic\nideas from this series of four or five arguments that Plato gives us.\nI'm going to criticize them. I don't think they work, though I want to\nremark before I turn to them that in saying this I'm not necessarily\ncriticizing Plato. As we'll see, some of the later arguments seem to be\ndeliberately aimed at answering objections that we can raise to some of\nthe earlier arguments. And so it might well be that Plato himself\nrecognized that the initial arguments aren't as strong as they need to\nbe.\n\nPlato wrote the dialogues as a kind of learning device, as a tool to\nhelp the reader get better at doing philosophy. They don't necessarily\nrepresent in a systematic fashion Plato's worked out axiomatic views\nabout the nature of philosophy. It could be that Plato's deliberately\nputting mistakes in earlier arguments so as to encourage you to think\nfor yourself, \"Oh, this is--here's a problem with this argument.\nThere's an objection with that argument.\" Some of these, Plato then may\naddress later on. But whether or not he does address them--we're not\ndoing Plato any honor, we're not doing him any service, if we limit\nourselves to simply trying to grasp, here's what Plato thought. We\ncould do the history of ideas and say, \"Here's Plato's views. Aren't\nthey interesting? Notice how they differ from Aristotle's views. Aren't\nthey interesting?\" and move on like that. But that's not what the\nphilosophers wanted us to do. The great philosophers had arguments that\nthey were putting forward to try to persuade us of the truths of their\npositions. And the way you show respect for a philosopher is by taking\nthose arguments seriously and asking yourself, do they work or not? So\nwhether or not the views that are being put forward in Socrates' mouth\nare the considered, reflective judgments of Plato or not, for our\npurposes we can just act as though they were the arguments being put\nforward by Plato, and we can ask ourselves, \"Do these arguments work or\ndon't they?\"\n\nSo I'm going to run through a series of these arguments. I'm going\nto, as I've mentioned before, be a bit more exegetical than is normally\nthe case for our readings. I'm going to actually pause, periodically\nlook at my notes and make sure I'm remembering how I think Plato\nunderstands the arguments. Of course, since the dialogue is indeed a\ndialogue, we don't always have the arguments laid out with a series or\npremises and conclusions. And so it's always a matter of\ninterpretation, what's the best reconstruction of the argument he's\ngesturing towards. How can we turn it into an argument with premises\nand conclusions? Well, that's what I'm going to try to do for us. Also\ngoing to give the arguments names. These are not names that Plato\ngives, but it will make it easy for us to get a fix, roughly, on the\ndifferent arguments as we move from one to the next.\n\nSo the first argument, and the worry that gets the whole things\ngoing, is this. So, we've got this nice Platonic picture where Plato\nsays, \"All right. So the mind can grasp the eternal forms, but it has\nto free itself from the body to do that.\" And so, the philosopher, who\nhas sort of trained himself to separate his mind from his body, to\ndisregard his bodily cravings and desires--the philosopher will welcome\ndeath because at that point he'll truly, finally, make the final break\nfrom the body.\n\nAnd the obvious worry that gets raised in the dialogue at this point\nis this: How do we know that when the death of the body occurs the soul\ndoesn't get destroyed as well? That's the natural worry to have. Maybe\nwhat we need to do is separate ourselves as much as possible from the\ninfluence of our body without actually going all the way and breaking\nthe connection. If you think about it like a rubber band, maybe the\nmore we can stretch the rubber band the better; but if you stretch too\nfar and the rubber band snaps, that's not good, that's bad. It could be\nthat we need the body in order to continue thinking. We want to free\nourselves from the distractions of the body, but we don't want the body\nto die, because when the body dies the soul dies as well. Even if we\nare dualists, as we've noticed before--even if the soul is something\ndifferent from the body--it could still be the case, logically\nspeaking, that if the body gets destroyed, the soul gets destroyed as\nwell.\n\nAnd so, Socrates' friends ask him, how can we be confident that the\nsoul will survive the death of the body and indeed be immortal? And\nthat's what prompts the series of arguments.\n\nNow, the first such argument I dub \"the argument from the nature of\nthe forms.\" And the basic thought is fairly straightforward. The ideas\nor the forms--justice itself, beauty itself, goodness itself--the forms\nare not physical objects. Right? We don't ever bump into justice\nitself. We bump into societies that may be more or less just, or\nindividuals who may be more or less just, but we never bump into\njustice itself. The number three is not a physical object. Goodness\nitself is not a physical object. Perfect roundness is not a physical\nobject. Now, roughly speaking, Socrates' seems to think it's going to\nfollow straightforwardly from that that the soul must itself be\nsomething non-physical. If the forms are not physical objects, then\nSocrates thinks it follows they can't be grasped. We can certainly\nthink about the forms, but if they're non-physical they can't be\ngrasped by something physical like the body. They've got to be grasped\nby something non-physical--namely, the soul.\n\nBut although that's, I think, the sketch of where Socrates wants to\ngo, it doesn't quite give us what we want. On the one hand, even if it\nwere true that the soul must be non-physical in order to grasp the\nnon-physical forms, wouldn't follow that the soul will survive the\ndeath of the body. That's the problem we've been thinking about for the\nlast minute. And there's something puzzling. We might wonder, well,\njust why is it that the body can't grasp the forms?\n\nSo there's a fuller version of the argument that's the one I want to\nfocus on. And indeed, I put it up on the board. [See Figure 7.1] So\nPlatonic metaphysics gives us premise number one--that ideas, forms,\nare eternal and they're non-physical. Two--that which is eternal or\nnon-physical can only be grasped by the eternal and the non-physical.\nSuppose we had both of those. It would seem to give us three, the\nconclusion we want--that which grasps the ideas or the forms must be\neternal or non-physical.\n\nWhat is it that grasps the ideas or the forms? Well, that's the\nsoul. If that which grasps the ideas or the forms must be\neternal/non-physical, well one thing we're going to get is, since that\nwhich grasps the forms must be non-physical, the soul is not the body.\nSince that which grasps the ideas or forms must be eternal or\nnon-physical--it's eternal, it's immortal.\n\nAll right. Let's look at this again more carefully. Ideas or forms\nare eternal; they're non-physical. Well, I've emphasized the\nnon-physical aspect, and I've emphasized as well that they're not\nchanging. But perhaps it's worth taking a moment to emphasize the\neternal aspect of the forms. Now, people may come and go, but perfect\njustice--the idea of perfect justice--that's timeless. Nothing that\nhappens here on Earth can change or alter or destroy the number three.\nTwo plus one equaled three before there were people; two plus one\nequals three now; two plus one will always equal three. The number\nthree is eternal, as well as being non-physical. So the Platonic\nmetaphysics says quite generally, if we're thinking about the ideas or\nthe forms, the point to grasp is they're eternal; they're\nnon-physical.\n\nThe crucial premise--since we're giving Plato number one--the\ncrucial premise for our purposes is premise number two. Is it or isn't\nit true that those things which are eternal or non-physical can only be\ngrasped by something that is itself eternal and non-physical? Again, it\ndoes seem as though the conclusion that he wants, number three, follows\nfrom that. If we give him number two, it's going to follow that\nwhatever's doing the grasping--call that the soul since the soul is\njust Plato's word for our mind--if whatever's doing the grasping of the\neternal and non-physical forms must itself be eternal and non-physical,\nit follows that the soul must be non-physical. So the physicalist view\nis wrong and the soul must be eternal. The soul is immortal. So\nSocrates has what he wants, once we give him premise number two, that\nthe eternal, non-physical can only be grasped by the eternal,\nnon-physical.\n\nAs Socrates puts it at one point, \"The impure cannot attain the\npure.\" Bodies--corruptible, destroyable, physical, passing--whether\nthey exist or not, whether they exist for a brief period and then they\ncease to exist--these impure objects cannot attain, cannot grasp,\ncannot have knowledge of the eternal, changeless non-physical forms.\n\"The impure cannot attain the pure.\"\n\nThat's the crucial premise, and what I want to say is, as far as I\ncan see there's no good reason to believe number two. Now, number two\nis not an unfamiliar--premise number two is not an unfamiliar claim. I\ntake it the claim basically is that, to put it in more familiar\nlanguage, it takes one to know one. Or to use it, slightly other kind\nof language that Plato uses at various points, \"Likes are known by\nlikes.\" But it takes one to know one is probably the most familiar way\nof putting the point. Plato's saying, \"What is it that we know? Well,\nwe know the eternal forms; takes one to know one. So we must ourselves\nbe eternal.\"\n\nUnfortunately, this thought, popular as it may be, that it takes one\nto know one, just seems false. Think about some examples. Well, let's\nsee, a biologist might study, or a zoologist might study, cats. Takes\none to know one, so the biologist must himself be a cat. Well, that's\nclearly false. You don't have to be feline to study the feline. Takes\none to know one; so, you can't be a Canadian and study Mexicans,\nbecause it takes one to know one. Well, that's just clearly stupid. Of\ncourse the Canadians can study the Mexicans and the Germans can study\nthe French. It does not take one to know one; to understand the truths\nabout the French, you do not yourself need to be French. Or take the\nfact that some doctors study dead bodies. Aha! So to study and grasp\nthings about dead bodies, corpses, you must yourself be a dead body.\nNo, that certainly doesn't follow. So if we start actually pushing\nourselves to think about examples--does it really take one to know\none--the answer is, at least as a general claim, it's not true. It\ndoesn't normally take one to know one.\n\nNow, strictly speaking, that doesn't prove that premise two is\nfalse. It could still be that, although normally you don't have to be\nlike the thing that you're studying in order to study it, although\nthat's not normally true, it could be that in the particular case of\nnon-physical objects, in the particular case of eternal objects, you do\nhave to be eternal, non-physical to study them. It could be that even\nthough the general claim, \"it takes one to know one\" is false, the\nparticular claim, \"eternal, non-physical can only be grasped by the\neternal, non-physical,\" maybe that particular claim is true. And it's\nonly the particular claim that Plato needs. Still, all I can say is,\nwhy should we believe two? Why should we think there's some--Even\nthough, normally, the barrier can be crossed and Xs can study the\nnon-X, why should that barrier suddenly become un-crossable in the\nparticular instance when we're dealing with Platonic forms? Give us\nsome reason to believe premise two. I can't see any good reason to\nbelieve premise two, and as far as I can see, Plato doesn't actually\ngive us any reason to believe it in the dialogue. Consequently, we have\nto say, as far as I can see, we haven't been given any adequate\nargument for the conclusion that the soul--which admittedly can think\nabout forms and ideas--we have no good reason yet to believe, to be\npersuaded, that the soul must itself be eternal and non-physical.\nThat's the first argument.\n\nAs I say though, Plato may well recognize the inadequacy of that\nargument, because after all Socrates goes on to offer a series of other\narguments. So let's turn to the next. I call the second argument \"the\nargument from recycling\"--not the best label I suppose, but I've never\nbeen able to come up with a better one. And the basic idea is that\nparts get re-used. Things move from one state to another state and then\nback to the first state. So, for example, to give an example that Plato\nactually gives in the dialogue, we are all awake now, but previously we\nwere asleep. We went from being in the realm of the asleep to being in\nthe realm of the awake, and we're going to return from the realm of the\nawake back to the realm of the asleep and over and over and over again.\nHence, recycling. I think that actually a better example for Plato's\npurposes, not that I expect him to have this particular example, but,\nwould be a car. Cars are made up of parts that existed before the car\nitself existed. There was the engine and the steering wheel and the\ntires and so forth. And these parts got assembled and put together to\nmake up a car. So the parts of the car existed prior to the existence\nof the car itself. And the time is going to come when the car will\ncease to exist but its parts will still be around. Right? It'll get\ntaken apart for parts, sold for parts. There will be the distributor\ncap, and there will be the tires, and there will be the carburetor,\nthere will be the steering wheel. Hence, the name, that I dub the\nargument, \"the argument from recycling.\"\n\nThat's the nature of reality for Plato. And it seems like a\nplausible enough view. Things come into being by being composed of\npreviously existing parts. And then, when those things cease to have\nthe form they had, the parts get used for other purposes. They get\nrecycled. If we grant that to Plato, he thinks we've got an argument\nfor the immortality of the soul. Because after all, what are the parts\nthat make us up? Well, there are the various parts of our physical\nbody, but there's also our soul. Remember, as I said, in introducing\nthe Phaedo, Plato doesn't so much argue for the existence of\nsomething separate, the soul, as presuppose it. His fundamental concern\nis to try to argue for the immortality of the soul. So he's just\nhelping himself to the assumption that there is a soul. It's one of the\nparts that makes us, that goes up into making us up, goes into making\nus up. It's one of the pieces that constitutes us. Given the thesis\nabout recycling, then, we have reason to believe the soul will continue\nto exist after we break. Even after our death, our parts will continue\nto exist. Our body continues to exist even after our death. Our soul\nwill continue to exist.\n\nWell, there's a problem with the argument from recycling, and it's\nthis. Even if the recycling thesis shows us that we're made up of\nsomething that existed before our birth and that some kinds of parts\nare going to have to exist after our death, we can't conclude that the\nsoul is one of the parts that's going to continue to exist after our\ndeath.\n\nConsider some familiar facts about human bodies. As we nowadays\nknow, human bodies are made up of atoms. And it's certainly true that\nthe atoms that make up my body existed long before my body existed. And\nit's certainly true that after my death those atoms are going to\ncontinue to exist. So there's some--and will eventually get used to\nmake something else. So Plato's certainly right about recycling as a\nfundamental truth. The things that make me up existed before, and will\ncontinue to exist after my death.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that every part of my body existed before I\nwas born, and that every part of my body will continue to exist after I\ndie. Take my heart. My heart is a part of my body. Yet, for all that,\nit didn't exist before my body began to exist. It came into existence\nas part of, along with, the creation of my body, and it won't continue\nto exist, at least not very long, after the destruction of my body.\nThere'll be a brief period in which, as a cadaver I suppose, my heart\nwill continue to exist. But eventually my body will decompose. We\ncertainly wouldn't have any grounds to conclude my heart is immortal,\nwill exist forever. That just seems wrong. So even though it's true\nthat some kind of recycling takes place, we can't conclude that\neverything that's now a part of me will continue to exist afterwards.\nIt might not have been one of the parts, one of the fundamental parts,\nfrom which I'm built--like the heart. And if that's right, if there can\nbe parts that I have now that weren't one of the parts from which I was\nmade, there's no particular reason to think it's going to be one of the\nparts that's going to continue to exist after I die.\n\nOnce we see that kind of worry, we have to see, look, the same thing\ncould be true for the soul. Even if there is an immortal soul--Sorry.\nEven if there is a non-physical soul that's part of me, we don't yet\nhave any reason to believe that it's one of the fundamental building\nblocks that were being recycled. We don't have adequate reason to\nconclude that it's something that existed before I was put together,\nit's something that will be recycled and continue to exist after I fall\napart, after my body decomposes, after I'm separated from my body, or\nwhat have you. Even if recycling takes place, we don't have any good\nreason yet to believe that the soul is one of the recycled parts. So it\nseems to me \"the argument from recycling,\" as I call it, is not\nsuccessful either.\n\nNow, as I say, many times when you read the dialogue, this or other\ndialogues by Plato, it seems as though he's fully cognizant of the\nobjections that at least an attentive reader will raise about earlier\nstages of the argument. Because sometimes the best way to understand a\nlater argument is to see it as responding to the weaknesses of earlier\narguments. And I think that's pretty clearly what's going on in the\nvery next argument that comes up in the dialogue. The objection I just\nraised, after all, to the argument from recycling, said, in effect,\neven though some kind of recycling takes place, not all my parts get\nrecycled, because not all of my parts were among the pre-existing\nconstituent pieces from which I am built up. We don't have any\nparticular reason to think my heart's one of the prior-existing pieces;\nwe don't have any good reason to assume that my soul's one of the\nprior-existing pieces.\n\nWell, Plato's very next argument attempts to persuade us that indeed\nwe do have reason to believe that the soul is one of the prior-existing\npieces. And this argument is known as \"the argument from recollection.\"\nThe idea is, he's going to tell us certain facts that need explaining,\nand the best explanation involves a certain fact about recollecting, or\na certain claim about recollecting or remembering. But we can only\nremember, he thinks, in the relevant way if our soul existed before the\nbirth of our body, before the creation of our body. All right.\n\nWhat's the crucial fact? Well, let's start by--Plato starts by\ntelling us, reminding us of what it is to remember something. Or\nperhaps a better word would be what is it to be reminded of something\nby something else that resembles it but is not the thing it reminds you\nof. I might have a photograph of my friend Ruth. And looking at the\nphotograph reminds me of Ruth. It brings Ruth to mind. I start thinking\nabout Ruth. I remember various things I know about Ruth. The photograph\nis able to do that, is able to trigger these thoughts. But of course,\nthe photograph is not Ruth. Right? Nobody would--who's thinking\nclearly--would confuse the photograph with my friend. But the\nphotograph resembles Ruth. It resembles Ruth well enough to remind me\nof her, and interestingly, it can do that even if it's not a very good\nphotograph. You might hold up the photograph and I might say, \"Gosh,\nthat really doesn't look very much like Ruth does it?\" Even though I\nsee that it is a photograph of Ruth; it reminds me of her.\n\nNow, how could it be that a photograph reminds me of my friend?\nWell, this isn't some deep mystery. Presumably the way it works is, as\nI just said, it looks sort of like her. It doesn't have to look very\nmuch like her. It looks sort of like her. Your young brother or sister,\nor my little children, can draw pictures of family members that barely\nlook like family members. My niece drew a picture of my family once\nwhen she was three. It didn't look very much like us at all, but we\ncould sort of see the resemblance in a vague kind of way, right? So\nit's got to look at least somewhat like the missing friend. But that's\nnot enough. You've never met Ruth, let's suppose. I hold up the\nphotograph without having told you anything about her. The photograph's\nnot going to remind you of Ruth. Why not? Well, you don't know Ruth. So\nthe pieces we need are not only an image of Ruth, even if an imperfect\nimage of Ruth, we also need some prior acquaintance with Ruth. That's\npretty much what it takes, right? So on the one hand--temporal\nsequence--first you know Ruth, you meet Ruth, you get to know Ruth.\nThen at a later time you're shown an image of Ruth--maybe not even an\nespecially good image of Ruth--but good enough to remind you. And\nsuddenly, you're remembering things you know about Ruth. That's how\nrecollection works. All right.\n\nNow, Plato points out that we all know things about the Platonic\nforms. But the Platonic forms, as we also know, are not to be found in\nthis world. The number three is not a physical object, perfect\nroundness is not a physical object, perfect goodness is not a physical\nobject. We can think about these things; our mind can grasp them, but\nthey're not to be found in this world. Yet, various things that we do\nfind in this world get us thinking about those things. I look at the\nplate on my kitchen table, it's not perfectly round, it's got\nimperfections; but suddenly I start thinking about circles, perfectly\nround objects. I look at somebody who's pretty. He or she is not\nperfectly beautiful, but suddenly I start thinking about the nature of\nbeauty itself. Ordinary objects in the world participate to a greater\nor lesser degree in the Platonic forms. That's Plato's picture of\nmetaphysics. And we bump up against, we look at, we have interactions\nwith these everyday objects and, somehow, they get us thinking about\nthe Platonic forms themselves. How does it happen? Plato has a theory.\nHe says, \"These things remind us of the Platonic forms.\" We see\nsomething that's beautiful to some degree, and it reminds us of perfect\nbeauty. We see something that's more or less round, and it reminds us\nof perfect circularity. We see somebody who's fairly decent morally,\nand it reminds us of perfect justice or perfect virtue. It's just like\nthe photograph, perhaps the not very good photograph, that reminds me\nof my friend Ruth.\n\nAll right. Well, there's an explanation of how it could be that\nthings that are not themselves perfectly round could remind us, could\nmake us think about perfect roundness. But then Plato says, \"Okay, but\nkeep in mind all of what you need in order to have reminding, to\nhave recollecting take place.\" In order for the photograph to remind me\nof Ruth, I have to already have met Ruth. I have to already be\nacquainted with her. In order for a more or less round plate to remind\nme of roundness, Plato says, I have to have already met perfect\nroundness itself. In order for a more or less just society to remind me\nof justice itself, so that I can start thinking about the nature of\njustice itself, I have to somehow have already been acquainted with\nperfect justice. But how and when did it happen? Not in this life, not\nin this world. In this world nothing is perfectly round, nothing is\nperfectly beautiful, nothing is perfectly just. So it's got to have\nhappened before. If seeing the photograph of my friend now can remind\nme of my friend, it's got to be because I met my friend before. If\nseeing things that participate in the forms remind me of the forms,\nit's got to be because I've met or been acquainted directly with the\nforms before. But you don't bump up against, you don't meet, you don't\nsee or grasp or become directly acquainted with, the forms in this\nlife. So it's got to have happened before this life.\n\nThat's Plato's argument. Plato says, thinking about the way in which\nwe grasp the forms helps us to see that the soul must have existed\nbefore birth, in the Platonic heavenly realm, directly grasping,\ndirectly communing with, directly understanding the forms. It's not\ntaking place in this life, so it has to have happened before.\n\nWell, look, now we've got the kind of argument we were looking for.\nEarlier the objection was, we had no good reason to think the soul was\none of the building blocks from which we're composed; we have no good\nreason to think it's one of the pieces that was around before our body\ngot put together, before our birth. Socrates says, \"No. On the\ncontrary, we do have reason, based on the argument from recollection,\nto conclude that the soul was around before we were born.\"\n\nAll right. So the next question is, is the argument from\nrecollection a good one? Now, let's say, I'm not really much concerned\nwith whether this was an argument that Plato thought worked or not. Our\nquestion is, do we think it works or not? Although this is a\nform of an argument that Plato does put forward in other dialogues as\nwell, and so it strikes me so there's at least some reason to think\nthis is an argument that he felt might well be right. The crucial\npremise--Again, we're going to just grant Plato the metaphysics. The\ncrucial question is going to be, is it right that in order to explain\nhow it is we could have knowledge of the forms now that we have to\nappeal to a prior existence in which we had direct acquaintance?\n\nIt's not obvious to me that that's true. It's not obvious to me for\na couple of reasons. One question is this: Is it really true that in\norder to think about the perfectly straight, I must have somehow,\nsomewhere at some point come up against, had direct knowledge of, the\nperfectly straight? Isn't it enough for me to extrapolate from cases\nthat I do come up against in this life? I come across things that are\nbent; I come across things that are more straight, more and more\nstraight. Can't my mind take off from there and push straight ahead to\nthe idea of the perfectly straight, even if I never have encountered it\nbefore?\n\nLet me stop with this idea. Even if Plato is right, that we need to\nhave acquaintance with the Platonic forms themselves in order to think\nabout them, and even if Plato is right that we never get the\nacquaintance in this world, in the interaction with ordinary physical\nobjects, why couldn't it be that our acquaintance with the Platonic\nforms comes about in this life for the very first time? That's the\nquestion, or that's the objection, that we'll turn to at the start of\nnext class.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct08.html":{"url":"lct08.html","title":"Lecture 8","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 8 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 8, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: We've been looking at Plato's\narguments for the immortality of the soul, and so far I have to say I\nhaven't found them very compelling arguments. In a minute, I'm going to\nturn to an argument that at least strikes me as more interesting. It's\nmore difficult to pin down where it goes wrong. But before we do, I\nwant to make a last couple of comments about the argument we were\nconsidering at the end of last class.\n\nThat was the argument from recollection. You recall the basic idea\nwas that although objects in the ordinary familiar empirical world are\nnot perfectly just, perfectly round, what have you, they're able to\nremind us of perfect justice, perfect roundness and the like. And when\nPlato asked himself, \"How could that be?\" the answer he gives is,\n\"Well, it's got to be that we were previously acquainted with the forms\nbefore our life in this world.\" And that shows that the soul must be\nsomething that existed prior to the creation of the body. That's the\nargument from recollection. And at the very end of class I suggested\nthat, look, even if we were to grant to Plato that in order to think\nabout justice, circularity, what have you, we had to somehow grasp the\nforms, and even if we were to grant to Plato that nothing in this world\nis perfectly round or perfectly just, it's not necessarily correct to\nsay, \"So the only possible explanation of what's going on is that these\nthings in the empirical world remind us of our prior acquaintance with\nthe forms.\"\n\nIt could be that what goes on is, when we bump up against something\nthat's partially just or partially beautiful or partially\nround--imperfectly round--what happens is, those things sort of trigger\nour minds in such a way that we begin to think about the forms for the\nvery first time. So it might be, in order to think about justice and\nroundness, we have to grasp the forms. But it could be that we only\ngrasp the forms in this life, for the very first time. Exposure to the\nthings that participate in the forms may nudge our minds or our souls\nin such a way that at that point--given that exposure--we begin to\ngrasp the forms. It's as though the ordinary earthly objects, we bump\ninto them or they bump into us, and they get us to look upwards to the\nheavenly Platonic realm. I don't mean literally upwards. It's not as\nthough these things--the number three--is up there. But if you accept\nthe metaphor, running into things in the empirical world gets our minds\nto start thinking about, for the first time, the heavenly realm of the\nPlatonic forms and ideas.\n\nThat would be just as likely a possibility as the alternative\nexplanation that what's going on is that ordinary empirical objects are\nreminding us of our prior acquaintance. Perhaps these ordinary objects\nact like letters of introduction, getting us to, helping us to, think\nabout the forms for the very first time. Well, if that's right, then of\ncourse, we don't have any good reason to follow Plato when he says, \"It\nmust be the case that the soul existed prior to the--prior to\nbirth.\"\n\nNow, the objection I've just raised is not an objection that Plato\nraises in the Phaedo, but he does raise a different objection.\nRemember our concern isn't, strictly speaking, with the question, \"Did\nthe soul exist before our birth? Did the soul exist before our bodies?\"\nbut rather, \"Is the soul immortal?\" And so, having now given the\nargument from recollection, Plato envisions two of Socrates' disciples,\nSimmias and Cebes, responding, objecting, by saying, \"Look, even if the\nsoul existed before birth, it doesn't follow that it exists after\ndeath. And that's, after all, what we really want, are wondering about.\nWe want to know, will we survive our deaths? Is the soul immortal? And\nyou haven't yet shown that Socrates,\" they object. Could be that it\nexisted before, but won't exist afterwards.\n\nBut very nicely--it's quite elegant structure at this\npoint--Socrates puts together the two arguments that we've just been\nrehearsing--the argument from recollection and the argument that came\nbefore that, the one that I dubbed \"the argument from recycling.\"\nRemember, the argument from recycling says, when you build something,\nyou build it out of parts, and when that thing falls apart you go back\nto the parts. All right. So the prior parts get recycled. The soul, we\nnow say--based on the argument from recollection--the soul is one of\nour prior parts. The soul existed before we were put together, or\nbefore we were put together with our bodies. If you then combine the\nargument from recycling and say, the parts that existed before are\ngoing to exist afterwards, it must follow that if the soul existed\nbefore, it will exist afterwards as well. And so we've got the\nimmortality of the soul after all.\n\nNow, bracket the fact that, as I just explained, I don't myself find\nthe argument from recollection persuasive. I don't think we've got any\ngood reason to believe--based on the sort of things that Plato is\ndrawing our attention to--I don't think we've got any good reason to\nbelieve that the soul existed before we were born. But even if we grant\nhim that, we shouldn't be so quick to conclude, on the basis of\ncombining the argument from recollection and the argument from\nrecycling, that the soul will continue to exist after the death of our\nbodies. After all, take a more familiar, humdrum example. Cars are\nbuilt out of non-cars, right? Cars get built out of engines and tires\nand steering wheels. And the engine is not a car; the steering wheel is\nnot a car. So you build the car out of its parts. Now, the engine is a\nprior-existing part. So can we conclude then that from the fact\nthat--argument from recycling: parts get reused, get rebuilt, when cars\nget destroyed, the parts are still around--can we conclude from the\nargument from recycling and the fact that the engine is a\nprior-existing part from which the car was built, that the engine will\ncontinue to exist forever after the destruction of the car? No,\nobviously you can't conclude that at all. Sometimes when cars get\ndestroyed the engine gets destroyed right along with it. And of course,\neven if--in many cases--the engine continues to exist for a while after\nthe destruction of the car, it certainly doesn't follow that the engine\nis immortal, that it continues to exist forever. Engines will\neventually decompose and turn back into atoms. So from the mere fact\nthat the engine was a part that existed before the car existed, and the\nfurther fact that when the car breaks down, it decomposes back into\nparts, it certainly doesn't follow that all of the parts that existed\nprior to the existence of the car will be around forever. That would\njust be false.\n\nSo even if we were to give Socrates the assumption that--the thesis\nthat--the soul existed before we were put together, before we were\nborn, it still wouldn't follow that the soul will continue to exist\nafter we're taken back apart. The soul might eventually decay just like\nthe engine will eventually decay. What we need, to really become\nconvinced of the immortality of the soul, is not the mere suggestion,\neven it was--even if we were convinced--is not the mere suggestion that\nthe soul was around before our birth. We need to believe that the soul,\nunlike an engine, can't itself be destroyed, can't itself decompose,\ncan't fall apart. That's what we need if we're really going to become\nconvinced of the immortality of the soul.\n\nNow, as I remarked previously, one of the amazing things--not\namazing but one of the really attractive things about Plato's dialogues\nis, you raise an objection and it often seems as though Plato himself,\nwhether or not he explicitly states the objection, seems aware of the\nobjection, because he'll go on to say something that is responsive to\nit. And again, that makes sense if you think of these dialogues as a\nkind of pedagogical tool to help you get better at philosophizing. So\nthe very next argument that Plato turns to can be viewed, I think, as\nresponding to this unstated objection--well, I stated it, but Plato\ndoesn't state it in the dialogue--the worry that even if the soul was\none of the parts, even if the soul was already around before we were\nborn, how do we know it can't come apart? How do we know the soul can't\nbe destroyed? Since what we want to know is whether the soul is\nimmortal, how do we know it can't break?\n\nPlato's next argument then tries to deal directly with this worry,\nand it's a quite interesting argument. I'll give it another--a new\nlabel--I'll call it the \"argument from simplicity.\" Socrates turns to a\ndiscussion of what kinds of things can break and what kinds of things\ncan't break; what kinds of things can be destroyed, and what kinds of\nthings can't be destroyed. He thinks about examples; he surveys\nexamples and tries to extract a kind of metaphysical principle from\nthis. And then, as we'll see, he's going to use this principle to\nconvince us--or to try to convince us--that the soul is immortal, it's\nindestructible.\n\nWell, lots of things can be destroyed. Here's a piece of paper. It\ncan be destroyed [sound of ripping paper] Right? Why was it that this\nwas the sort of thing that could be destroyed? Well, the\nstraightforward answer is the piece of paper had parts. And in breaking\nit, in ripping it, what I literally did was I ripped one part from\nanother. To destroy the piece of paper, I take its parts apart. Here's\npiece of chalk. The piece of chalk can be broken. What am I doing?\nTaking its parts apart. The kinds of things that can be destroyed have\nparts. They are composite. They are composed of their parts. Bodies can\nbe destroyed because you can take a sword to it and go sweep, sweep,\nsweep and chop it into pieces. Composite things can be destroyed.\nThings that have parts can be destroyed.\n\nNow, what kind of things can't be destroyed? Well, it won't surprise\nyou that when Plato looks for an example of something that's eternal\nand indestructible, his mind immediately starts thinking about the\nPlatonic forms. Take the number three. The number three can't be\ndestroyed, right? Even if nuclear explosion took place and everything\non Earth got atomized and destroyed through some bizarre science\nfiction chain reaction, like they're always doing in movies, the number\nthree wouldn't be touched. The number three wouldn't be fazed. It would\nstill be true that three plus one equals four. You can't hurt the\nnumber three. You can't alter or destroy perfect circularity. Why not?\nWell, it doesn't have any parts. That's the thought. Things like the\nPlatonic forms are eternal, and they're eternal, changeless, and\nindestructible, because they are simple--simple here being the\nmetaphysical notion that they're not composed of anything. Anything\nthat's built up out of parts you could, at least in principle, worry\nabout the parts coming apart and, hence, the thing being destroyed. But\nanything that's simple can't be destroyed in that way. It has no parts\nto take apart.\n\nSo the kinds of things that can be destroyed are the things with\nparts, and those are the sorts of things that change, right? Even if\nthey're not destroyed, what's a tip off to something being composite?\nThe fact that it changes. Suppose I take a bar of metal and I bend it.\nI haven't destroyed it, but I've changed it. I'm able to change it by\nrearranging the relationships between the various parts. My body is\nconstantly changing because the relationships between my arms and my\nhead and so forth, my muscles are moving. You rearrange the parts, the\nthing changes. Oh, but that means it's got parts and could be\ndestroyed. So we've got some nice generalizations. Things that change\nhave parts; things with parts can be destroyed. What are the kinds of\nthings that you can change and destroy? Those are the familiar\nempirical objects that we can see: pieces of paper, bodies, pieces of\nchalk, bars of metal.\n\nIn contrast, on the whole other side, you've got things that are\ninvisible, like the number three--nobody sees the number three--things\nthat are invisible, that never change. The number three never changes,\nright? The number three is an odd number. It's not as though, oh, today\nit's odd but maybe tomorrow it'll be even. It's eternally an odd\nnumber. Three plus one equals four today, yesterday and forever. These\nfacts about the number three will never change. The number three is\nchangeless. So the forms are eternal; they're invisible; they are\nchangeless. They're simple, and simple things can't be destroyed; forms\ncan't be destroyed.\n\nYou put all this together; these are the sorts of thoughts that\nSocrates assembles, and I've got the initial thoughts up there on the\nboard. [See Figure 8.1] All right.\n\nSo premise number one, only composite things can be destroyed.\nPremise number two, only changing things are composite. So if you put\none and two together, you'd get: only changing things could be\ndestroyed. And now add three, invisible things don't change. Well, if\nyou've got to be the kind of thing that can change in order to be\ncomposite and you've got to be composite in order to be destroyed,\ninvisible things don't change, follows four, invisible things can't be\ndestroyed. That's the metaphysical thesis that Socrates comes to by\nthinking about cases. And that's the crucial premise or sub-conclusion\nfor the immortality of the soul, because then Socrates invites us to\nthink about the soul. Is the soul visible or invisible? He says, pretty\nobviously, \"it's invisible.\" But if invisible things can't be\ndestroyed, the soul can't be destroyed. So one, two and three got us\nfour, invisible things can't be destroyed, but five, the soul is\ninvisible so six, the soul can't be destroyed. That's my best attempt\nat reconstructing the argument from simplicity. It's not as though\nPlato himself spells it out with premises and conclusions like that,\nbut I think this is fairly faithful to the kind of argument he means to\nput forward.\n\nAnd in a moment I'll turn to evaluating whether that's a good\nargument or not. But I think it's a pretty interesting argument; it's\nan argument worth taking fairly seriously. Except, I've got to confess\nto you that Socrates doesn't quite conclude the way I would've thought\nhe would've concluded. So I've had the argument conclude six, the soul\ncan't be destroyed. But what Socrates actually says is--his actual\nconclusion is--\"And so the soul is indestructible or nearly so.\" That's\nrather an odd qualification, \"or nearly so.\" The conclusion that\nSocrates reaches from his examination of change and invisibility and so\nforth and so on, and compositeness versus simplicity, is that \"the soul\nis indestructible or nearly so.\"\n\nNow, adding that qualification opens the door to a worry. The worry\ngets raised by Cebes who says, even if we grant that the soul is nearly\nindestructible, that's not good enough to get us immortality. And he\ngives a very nice analogy of somebody who's--a coat, which could\noutlast the owner but isn't immortal. Or the owner could go through\nseveral coats; but still at some point the owner's going to die as\nwell. The owner is far more immortal, in that sense, closer to\nimmortality. And I've gone through many coats in my life, but for all\nthat, I'm not indestructible. If all we've got is the mere fact that\nthe soul is \"nearly\" indestructible, it takes a whole lot more work to\ndestroy it, maybe it lasts a whole lot longer; maybe it goes through a\nwhole lot of bodies being reincarnated a half-dozen, or a dozen, or\nhundred times before it wears out and gets destroyed. That's not enough\nto give us the immortality of the soul. That's the objection that Cebes\nraises. And one of the oddities is that, as far as I can see, Socrates\nnever responds to that objection. Raises the objection--that is, Plato\nraises the objection in the voice of Cebes--but Socrates, on Plato's\nbehalf, never answers the objection.\n\nIt's hard to say what exactly is going on. It might be that Plato's\nworried that he hasn't really shown that the soul is immortal\nafterwards. Maybe this argument from simplicity isn't really as good as\nit needs to be. And maybe that explains why Plato then goes on to offer\nyet another argument. After all, if this argument really did show the\nimmortality of the soul, why would he need to offer a further\nargument?--The argument from essential properties, which we'll be\nturning to later. So maybe Plato just thought there wasn't a good\nanswer to Cebes' objection. But I want to say, on Plato's behalf, or at\nleast on behalf of the argument, Socrates should never have concluded\nthe argument with this odd qualifying phrase that the soul is\n\"indestructible or nearly so.\" He should've just said the soul is\nindestructible, full stop.\n\nAfter all, if we have premises one, two, and three--only composite\nthings can be destroyed, only changing things are composite, invisible\nthings don't change--if you put those together, you get four, invisible\nthings can't be destroyed. You don't get the more modest conclusion,\n\"invisible things can't be destroyed or it's a whole lot harder to\ndestroy them.\" If we've got one, two and three, we're entitled to the\nbold conclusion: \"invisible things can't be destroyed, period.\" Full\nstop. And then if five is true, if the soul really is invisible, we're\nentitled to conclude six, the soul can't be destroyed--not, the soul\ncan't be destroyed, or if it can be destroyed it's very, very hard and\ntakes a very, very long time. We are, rather, entitled to the bolder\nconclusion, the soul can't be destroyed, full stop, period, end of the\ndiscussion.\n\nSo despite the fact that Socrates draws this weaker conclusion, it\nseems to me that the argument he's offered us, if it works at all,\nentitles us to draw the bolder conclusion. Not that the soul is\nindestructible or nearly so, but that the soul is indestructible. Well,\nmaybe Plato realized that; maybe that's the reason why he doesn't\nbother giving an answer to Cebes. Maybe it's an invitation to the\nreader to recognize that there's a better argument here than even the\ncharacters in the drama have noticed--don't know, don't know what Plato\nhad in mind.\n\nBut at any rate, our question shouldn't be, \"What was Plato\nthinking?\" but, \"Is the argument any good?\" Do we now have an argument\nfor the immortality of the soul? After all, if the soul can't be\ndestroyed, it's immortal. Is it a good argument or not?\n\nSimmias raises a different objection. Simmias says we can't conclude\nthat the soul is indestructible, or nearly so, or whatever, because we\nshould not believe the sub-conclusion four, invisible things can't be\ndestroyed. Simmias says invisible things can be destroyed. And\nif that's true, then of course we no longer have an argument for the\nindestructibility or near indestructibility of the soul. Because even\nif the soul is invisible, five, if nonetheless, contrary to what\nSocrates was claiming, invisible things can be destroyed, then maybe\nthe invisible soul can be destroyed as well.\n\nNow, Simmias doesn't merely assert, boldly, invisible things can be\ndestroyed. He offers an example of an invisible thing that can be\ndestroyed--harmony. He starts talking about the harmony that gets\nproduced by a stringed instrument; let's say a harp. In fact, he says,\nthis is a very nice example for us to think about because some people\nhave suggested--Simmias says--some people have suggested that the mind\nis like harmony. It's as though the mind is like harmony of the body.\nSo to spell out the analogy a bit more fully, and I'll say a bit more\nabout it later, harmony is to the harp as the mind is to the body. All\nright. He says, there are people who put forward views like this, and\nat any rate harmony can certainly be destroyed. You don't see harmony,\nright? Harmony is invisible. But for all that, you can destroy harmony.\nSo there's the harp making its melodious, harmonious sounds, and then\nyou take an ax to the harp, bang, bang, bang, chop, chop, chop, or a\nhammer or whatever; now the harmony's been destroyed. So even though\nit's invisible, you can destroy it by destroying the musical instrument\non which it depends.\n\nAnd of course, there's the worry, right? If the mind is like the\nharmony of the body, then maybe you could destroy the mind, the soul,\nby destroying the body on which the mind depends. So the crucial point\nright now is that thinking about harmony is offered as a counterexample\nto the generalization that invisible things can't be destroyed. Harmony\nis invisible. Harmony can be destroyed. So invisible things can be\ndestroyed. So you're wrong, Socrates, when you say invisible things\ncan't be destroyed. So even if we grant that the soul is invisible as\nwell, maybe the soul also is an invisible thing that can be\ndestroyed.\n\nThat's a great objection. It's an objection worth taking very\nseriously. And the oddity is, Socrates doesn't respond to it in the way\nthat he should have, in the way that he needed to. Socrates instead\nspends some time worrying about the question, \"Is the soul really like\nharmony or not?\" Is this metaphor--think about the relationship between\nthe mind and body as similar to the relationship between harmony and a\nharp--Socrates spends some time criticizing that analogy.\n\nNow, in a few minutes I'll turn to the question, what about\nSocrates' criticisms of the analogy? Are they good criticisms or not?\nBut even if they are good criticisms, I want to say, that's not good\nenough to help your argument Socrates. Even if we were to say, you know\nwhat? The mind isn't very much like harmony at all. That analogy really\nstinks. So what? All that Simmias needs to cause problems for Socrates'\nargument is the claim that harmony is invisible and harmony can be\ndestroyed. As long as that is true, we can't continue to believe that\ninvisible things can't be destroyed.\n\nSo what Socrates needs to do is to say either harmony can't be\ndestroyed, but pretty obviously it can, the melodious sounds coming out\nof an instrument can be destroyed. So he would need to argue then,\nperhaps, that harmony is not really invisible. If he could show us, if\nhe could convince us, that harmony is not really invisible, then we\nwould no longer have a counterexample to the claim that the invisible\ncan't be destroyed, and the argument could still then proceed as it was\nbefore.\n\nSo that's what Socrates should have done. He should have said, \"You\nknow what? Harmony is not really invisible,\" or \"It can't be\ndestroyed.\" But there's not a whiff of that, at least in the dialogue\nas we've got it, not a whiff of that as far as I can see. Socrates\nnever says, \"Simmias, here is where your objection goes wrong. Harmony\nis not really invisible, can't really be destroyed, whatever it is. So\nwe don't really have a counterexample.\" Instead, he gets hung up on\nthis question, \"Is it a good analogy? Is it a good way for thinking\nabout the mind or not?\" But even if it isn't, that wouldn't save the\nargument.\n\nNow, I am going to take some time to think about whether or not\nharmony is a good analogy, because I actually think it is a good\nanalogy. I think what's going on in the harmony--the suggestion that we\nshould think about the mind like harmony, as though it was the harmony\nof the body--is an early attempt to state the physicalist view. Talk\nabout the mind, says the physicalist, is just a way of talking about\nthe body. Or, more carefully, it's a way of talking about certain\nthings the body can do when it's functioning properly, when it's well\ntuned, as we might put it. Just like, talk about the harmony or the\nmelodious sounds or what have you of the harp, is a way--these things\nare a way of talking about what things the harp can do. It can produce\nmelodious, harmonious sounds when it's functioning properly, when it's\nwell tuned. So the harmony analogy is, I think, an attempt, and not a\nbad attempt, at gesturing towards the question, how do physicalists\nthink about the mind?\n\nNow, when I tried to get you to grasp how physicalists think about\nthe mind, I used examples about computers and robots and the like.\nWell, it's not remotely surprising that Plato doesn't use those kinds\nof analogies. He doesn't have computers; he doesn't have robots. Still,\nhe has physical objects that can do things. And the ability to do\nthings depends on the proper functioning of the physical object. And\nso, I think he can see that there's this alternative to his dualism. He\ncan see you could be a physicalist and say that the mind is dependent\non the body; the mind is just a way of talking about what the body can\ndo when it's working properly. It's dependent just the same way that,\nwell, for example, harmony is dependent upon the physical instrument.\nSo I think it's a very nice attempt to discuss the physicalist\nalternative to Plato's dualism. And that's why it will be worth taking\nsome time to ask ourselves, well, what about Plato's objections then?\nIf he can convince us that the soul is not like harmony of the body,\nmaybe that will be some sort of problem for the physicalists. So I'll\ncome back to that in a few more minutes.\n\nBut first, let's worry about the point that I was emphasizing\nearlier, namely, even if the soul's not very much like harmony, so\nwhat? If harmony really is invisible and harmony really can be\ndestroyed, then invisible things can be destroyed. Even if the soul's\nnothing like--that's not a good analogy for thinking about the\nphysicalist position or what have you--so what? If some invisible\nthings can be destroyed and harmony is an example of that, then, by\ngolly, it's going to follow that we can't conclude from the\ninvisibility of the soul that the soul cannot be destroyed. So even\nthough Socrates doesn't respond to that objection, we need to ask on\nSocrates' behalf, is there a possible answer to this objection? And I\nthink there are at least the beginnings of one.\n\nWe have to ask: when we say, \"invisible things can't be destroyed,\"\nwhat did we mean by \"invisible?\" And I want to distinguish three\ndifferent possible interpretations, three different claims. [See Figure\n8.2] So invisible means, one, there's one possibility, can't be seen.\nTwo, different possibility, can't be observed. I've got in mind the\nbroader notion of all five senses. Three, different possible\ninterpretation of invisible, can't be detected.\n\nWhat we have to ask ourselves is, when Socrates puts his argument\nforward, which of these did he have in mind? First, let's be clear on\nhow these things are different. Some things can't be seen but can be\nsensed some other way. So colors can be seen; smells cannot be seen,\nbut of course smells--the smell of coffee--can be sensed through the\nfive senses. Sounds can't be seen, they're not visible, but for all\nthat they can be sensed. You can hear them through your ears. So,\nwithout getting hung up on what does the English word \"invisible\" mean,\nlet's just notice that there's a difference between saying \"it can't be\nseen through the eyes\" and \"can't be observed through one sense or the\nother.\" And then three is a different notion altogether, a stronger\nnotion altogether. There might be things that can't even be detected\nthrough any of the five senses. The number three--not only can't I see\nit, I can't taste it, I can't hear it, I can't smell it, can't touch\nit, right? The number three is invisible in this much bolder way. It\ncan't be detected at all by the five senses--can't be detected in terms\nof its--it doesn't leave traces behind, right? I don't see dinosaurs,\nbut of course they leave traces behind in fossils. There's a way in\nwhich you can talk about it being detected by its effects. All\nright.\n\nSo again, don't get hung up on what does the English word invisible\nmean. Let's just ask ourselves, what notion of invisibility--if we'll\nuse the word between these three ways--what notion did Socrates'\nargument turn on? Well, the most natural way to start by interpreting\nhim is with number one. When he says, \"Invisible things don't change,\"\nwhat he means is, things that you can't see don't change, and\nso--continue to interpret invisible in number four the same\nway--invisible things can't be destroyed. On the first interpretation\nwhat he'd be saying is, \"If you can't see it with your eyes, it can't\nbe destroyed.\" Now, the trouble is, harmony shows that that's not so.\nHarmony is indeed invisible in sense number one. You cannot see it with\nyour eyes. But for all that, it can be destroyed. So if what Socrates\nmeans by invisibility is the first notion, can't been seen with your\neyes, then the argument's not any good. Harmony is a pretty compelling\ncounterexample.\n\nBut maybe that's not what Socrates means by invisible. Maybe instead\nof one, he means two. When he talks about the soul being invisible and\ninvisible things being indestructible, maybe he means things that can't\nbe observed through any of your five senses. Now, in point of fact, I\nthink that is what he meant. Let me just give a quick quote. In our\nedition, this is page 29. Some of you may have noticed that there are\nlittle standardized paginations in our edition as well. So it's in the\nacademy paginations, number 79; he's talking about the difference\nbetween the visible and the invisible things, chairs versus the forms.\nAnd he says, \"These latter, chairs, trees, stones, you could touch and\nsee and perceive with the other senses. But those that always remain\nthe same, the forms, can only be grasped by the reasoning power of the\nmind. They are not seen but are invisible.\" So I think it's pretty\nclear that when Socrates starts talking about what's visible versus\ninvisible, he doesn't mean to limit himself to vision; he means to be\ntalking about all of the five senses. So when we say--when he\nsays--\"Invisible things can't be destroyed,\" he means the things that\nyou can't see or touch or hear or feel--whatever it is--see, touch,\nsmell, taste. Those things can't be destroyed.\n\nNow, notice that if that's the way we interpret his argument,\nharmony no longer works as a counterexample. Harmony was invisible when\nwe meant definition number one, can't be seen. But it's not invisible\nif we mean definition number two, can't be sensed, can't be observed.\nHarmony can be sensed through the ears, in which case it's not a\ncounterexample. It's not a counterexample to four. Four says,\n\"Invisible things can't be destroyed.\" And what Socrates should have\nsaid is, harmony is not invisible in the relevant sense of invisible,\nsince it can be sensed. But--and this would be the crucial\npoint--notice, Socrates should've continued, the soul is\ninvisible in that sense. You don't see the soul; you don't taste the\nsoul; you don't touch the soul; you don't hear the soul. So if we\nunderstand the argument in terms of the second interpretation of\ninvisible, it looks as though the argument still goes through. Simmias'\ncounterexample fails. Harmony is not invisible in the relevant sense,\nso it could still be true that invisible things can't be destroyed.\nSince the soul is invisible in that sense, it would follow that the\nsoul can't be destroyed.\n\nHowever, even if Simmias' objection, his particular counterexample,\nharmony, fails, that doesn't mean that we should still accept the\nargument because there might be a different counterexample. So here's\nmy proposal. Suppose we think not about harmony but radio waves. Radio\nwaves are not sensible. They are not observable. You don't see a radio\nwave. You can't touch a radio wave; you can't smell a radio wave, and\ninterestingly enough, you can't hear radio waves. But of course, for\nall that, they can be destroyed. So even if we grant that what Socrates\nmeant by invisible was \"cannot be observed,\" we still have to say, with\nSimmias, \"You know, four is just not true. Some invisible things can be\ndestroyed.\" Radio waves can be destroyed even though they're invisible\nin the relevant sense. Yeah? Question?\n\nStudent: [inaudible]\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Okay. So the suggestion was, radio\nwaves are a bit like the forms.\n\nStudent: [inaudible]\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: They're not forms, but they're\nperfect in that way. Was that the thought?\n\nStudent: [inaudible]\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Ah! Okay, I misunderstood. So the\nquestion is rather, \"Look, radio waves are not like forms,\" to which\nthe answer is \"Yes, that's exactly the problem.\" They are invisible,\nlike the forms, but unlike the forms they're destructible. And that's\nprecisely why we've got to worry about the soul. Is the soul invisible\nin the way the forms are, being indestructible, or is it invisible in\nthe way that radio waves are, destructible? Now again, my point here is\nnot to say, \"Oh, you idiot, Plato! Why didn't you think of radio\nwaves?\" Our question is not, was Plato overlooking something he\nshould've thought of? It's, does his argument work or not? Is it true\nthat the invisible things can't be destroyed? And it seems to me that\nsome things that are invisible in the relevant sense, radio waves being\nan example of that, can be destroyed. So even though the soul is also\ninvisible in the relevant sense, maybe it can be destroyed as well.\n\nNow, the answer, it seems to me, the only answer I can imagine\nSocrates or Plato giving at this point, is to say, \"Look, I need a\ndifferent definition of invisible. Not two, but three. Don't talk about\nwhat we can sense; talk about what we can detect.\" Radio waves can be\ndetected, right? After all, radios do that. You turn on your radio, the\nradio wave's passing by, boom--properly tuned, you detect it. It turns\nit into these sounds that we can hear. We can detect radio waves on the\nbasis of their effects on radios, among other things. So maybe by\ninvisible he should've moved to this stronger, bolder definition of\ninvisible. Let's call something invisible not only if it can't seen,\nnot only if it can't be observed, but if it can't be detected at all.\nLook, the forms, after all, can't be detected. There's no radio for the\nnumber three that will tell--There's no Geiger counter to tell you the\nnumber three is nearby or something, right? So Plato could still insist\nthings that are invisible, in the sense of undetectable, can't be\ndestroyed. But radio waves, they're detectable. So they're not a\ncounterexample, now that we interpret the relevant notion of\ninvisibility as undetectability.\n\nSo couldn't Plato continue to claim, things that are fully\ninvisible, meaning undetectable, those things can't be destroyed. Radio\nwaves aren't a counterexample to that. I think maybe Plato could say\nthat. But, if we give him four, where we read invisible as meaning\nutterly undetectable, it's no longer so clear to me that we can give\nhim five. Is the soul invisible? Well, it was, when by invisibility we\nmeant can't be seen; it was, when by invisibility we meant can't be\ntasted or touched or heard or smelled. But is it still invisible if by\ninvisibility we mean can't be detected? Is it true that the soul can't\nbe detected? I've got to say, I think it's no longer right. Once we\ninterpret invisibility that way, the soul is detectable in just the\nway--not literally just the way, but in something similar to the\nway--that radio waves are detectable. If you hook a radio wave up with\na radio, you can tell the radio is--radio wave--was there because of\nwhat the radio's doing, giving off these sounds. If you hook a soul up\nto a body, you can tell the soul is there by what the body is doing,\ndiscussing philosophy with you. You detect the presence of your\nfriend's soul through its effects on your friend's body.\n\nBut that means the soul isn't really undetectable. But if the soul's\nnot really undetectable, it's not really invisible in the relevant\nsense. And if it's not really invisible, then even if there is a notion\nof invisible, such that things that are invisible in that sense can't\nbe destroyed, the soul's not invisible in that sense.\n\nI've gone over this argument at such length because--I hope it's\nclear--I think it's a pretty interesting argument. The argument from\nsimplicity is quite fascinating. The idea that you couldn't break the\nsoul if it didn't have parts, and the way to tell that it doesn't have\nparts is because it's invisible, because invisible things can't have\nparts, that's a quite difficult argument to pin down, does it work or\ndoes it not work. But I think, as we think it all through, we have to\nconclude it doesn't work. Okay.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct09.html":{"url":"lct09.html","title":"Lecture 9","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 9 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 13, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: We've been working our way through\nPlato's arguments for the immortality of the soul. And last time I\nspent a fair bit of time working through objections to, not quite the\nlast argument we're going to look at, but the penultimate argument, in\nwhich Plato tries to argue for the simplicity of the soul. The set of\nconnected ideas, you'll recall, were these: that Plato wants to suggest\nthat in order to be destroyed you've got to have parts; to destroy\nsomething is to basically take its parts apart. If he could only\nconvince us that the soul was simple, it would follow that it was\nindestructible and, hence, immortal. He asks, what's our evidence for\nsome things being indestructible? What kinds of things are simple?\nWell, these are--he then goes on to claim--invisible things, things\nthat don't change. After all, changing is a matter of the rearrangement\nof the parts. And so, if something can change, it can't be simple.\nMaybe it could be destroyed. But if we could become convinced that the\nsoul was not composite, if it was something that couldn't change, then\nit would simple. Perhaps then it would indestructible. And then he goes\non to suggest that the invisibility of the soul is evidence for it's\nbeing changeless, and hence simple, and hence indestructible. So that's\nthe argument we worked through last time. And I spent a fair bit of\ntime suggesting that if you pin down precisely what Plato means by\ninvisible, the argument doesn't actually go through.\n\nBefore leaving that argument, there are a couple of extra remarks I\nwant to make about it. First, we probably shouldn't have been so quick\nto want to buy into the suggestion that the soul is changeless. After\nall, if you think about it, it seems that at least on the face of it\nthe soul does indeed change. On one day you believe, for example, that\nit's hot; on another day you believe that it's cold. On one day you\nbelieve that so and so is a nice person; on the next day you believe\nthat so and so is a mean person. You desire to learn the piano, the\nnext day you give up on that desire. Your beliefs, your goals, your\nintentions, your desires--these things are all constantly changing. And\nso, at least on the face of it, it looks as though we might well want\nto say the soul--if we do believe there are souls--the soul is changing\nas well, in terms of what thoughts and beliefs it's housing.\n\nSo we should have been skeptical in the first place of any argument\nthat said, based on the invisibility of the soul, we can conclude that\nit's changeless. It doesn't seem to be in fact changeless. Furthermore,\nwe should be, or at least we might well be, skeptical of the claim that\nthe soul is simple. Indeed, Plato himself, in other dialogues, argues\nagainst the simplicity of the soul. Now, that doesn't mean he's right\nin the other dialogues, but at least suggests that we shouldn't be so\nready to assume that sort of position is correct. In The\nRepublic, famously, Plato goes on to argue that the soul has at\nleast three different parts. There's a rational part that's in charge\nof reasoning; there's a spirited part that's sort of like the will;\nthere's a part that has to do with appetite, desires for food, drink,\nsex, what have you. Plato elsewhere argues the soul is not simple at\nall. So perhaps it shouldn't shock us that the argument he's sketching\nhere for the simplicity of the soul based on the changeless, invisible\nnature of the soul--perhaps it shouldn't shock us that that argument\ndoesn't succeed after all.\n\nFinally, although I gave Plato, previously, the assumption that if\nonly we could establish the simplicity of the soul, it would follow\nthat soul was indestructible--after all, you couldn't break a soul by\ntearing its pieces apart if it didn't have pieces, if it didn't have\nparts--nonetheless, I just want to register the thought that it's not\nactually obvious that simples can't be destroyed. Well, they clearly\ncan't be destroyed by the particular method of destruction that\ninvolves taking them apart. If they don't have parts, you can't take\nthem apart. But for all that, it still seems conceptually possible for\na simple to be destroyed in the following sense: it goes out of\nexistence. After all, where did the simples come from in the first\nplace? Well, at least from a logical point of view, it seems as though\nthere's no difficulty in imagining that at one point a given simple\ndidn't exist and then at the next point it popped into existence. Well,\nhow did that happen? Maybe God said--God says at the beginning of\nGenesis, \"Let there be light.\" So maybe He says, \"Let there be\nsimples.\" At a given moment they weren't there; the next moment they\nwere. Well, after a while maybe God says, \"Let the simples no longer\nexist.\" Given moment there they were; the next moment, they no longer\nexist.\n\nSeems as though that idea makes sense, and so even if we agreed that\nthe soul was simple, even if we granted everything in Plato's argument\nup to this point and said, \"the soul really is simple,\" it still\nwouldn't follow that it's immortal. We'd still have to worry about the\npossibility that the simple soul might simply pop out of existence at a\ngiven point, perhaps the very point when the body gets destroyed. So\nI'm inclined to think that this most recent argument of Plato's--the\nargument from simplicity--no, that's not successful either.\n\nBefore leaving that argument, there's one other piece of\nbusiness I want to discuss. This is a footnote that I put aside, a\npoint that I put aside previously. You'll recall that we were worried\nabout--The objection got raised the right way to think about the soul\nis like the harmony of a harp. And this was originally offered as a\ncounterexample to the thought that invisible things couldn't be\ndestroyed. But harmony could be destroyed. It was invisible, so\ninvisible things could be destroyed. But I noticed, I mentioned that,\nlook, whether or not this is a problem for the argument, it's an\ninteresting suggestion in its own right. Because the suggestion that\nthe mind is to the body, the soul is to the body, like harmony is to an\ninstrument with strings, seems to me to be an early attempt to describe\nsomething like the physicalist conception of the mind. Just as harmony\nis something that gets produced by a well-tuned instrument, the soul or\nthe mind is something that gets produced by a well-tuned body. Now\nPlato's got some objections to the suggestion that we should think of\nthe mind as the harmony of the body. And so I want to take just a\nmoment and talk about those objections because, of course, if they were\ncompelling objections that might well give us reason to doubt the\nphysicalist view. Whether or not Plato's arguments for the immortality\nof the soul work, he might still have some good arguments against the\nphysicalist conception.\n\nBut in thinking about these objections, it's important to bear in\nmind that it's only meant--the harmony analogy is only meant--as just\nthat, as an analogy. Right? The claim isn't, or at least it shouldn't\nbe, understood as saying literally, \"the mind is harmony.\" It's rather,\nthe mind is like harmony; it's the sort of thing to the body\nlike harmony is to a harp, something that can be produced by a\nwell-functioning, well-tuned physical object. A well-tuned instrument\ncan produce melody and harmony. A well-tuned, properly functioning body\ncan produce mental activity. That's the suggestion. And so even if it\nturns out that there are some ways in which the mind isn't exactly like\nharmony, it doesn't show us that the physicalist view is wrong.\n\nWell, so let's quickly look at what Plato's arguments were.\nFirst--this is, I think, an interesting argument--Plato says, harmony\nclearly cannot exist before the existence of the harp itself. Right?\nThe melodiousness of the harp can't exist prior to the physical\nconstruction of the harp. And if mind were the sort of thing that was\nproduced by the proper functioning of the physical body, then pretty\nobviously the mind could not exist prior to the creation of the\nphysical body. However, Plato has already argued earlier in the\ndialogue that the soul does exist prior to the existence of the body.\nThat's the argument from recollection. If the soul exists prior to the\nbody, it can't be like harmony; physicalism has clearly got to be\nfalse.\n\nBut I said that I didn't find the argument--I tried to explain why I\ndidn't find the argument from recollection persuasive. I certainly do\nwant to agree that if we became convinced that the soul did exist prior\nto the existence of the body, we would certainly want to agree that the\nsoul is not like harmony. But I don't think the argument from\nrecollection succeeds.\n\nPlato's second objection is to point out that harmony can vary. We\ntalk about the melodiousness of the harp. Well, it could be harmonious\nin a variety of different ways and, indeed, to different degrees.\nSomething--an instrument--could be more or less harmonious. What it's\nplaying can be in greater or lesser harmony. But it doesn't seem as\nthough souls come in degrees. You've got a soul or you don't have a\nsoul. That's the argument, that's the objection. You've got a mind or\nyou don't have a mind. But perhaps we should--That's the objection, and\nof course if that was right then again we might have to conclude, well,\nwhatever the mind is, it's not quite like harmony is to the body.\n\nBut I'm not so sure we should agree that the mind can't come in\ndegrees. It can at least--The mental aspects can come in degrees. We\ncan have varying degrees of intelligence, varying degrees of\ncreativity, varying degrees of reasonableness, varying degrees of\nability to communicate. So just as, we might say, just as the\nfunctioning of the harp can come in varying degrees--more or less\nharmony--the functioning of the body in terms of its mind can come in\nvarying degrees. So that second objection doesn't seem to me very\ncompelling.\n\nThird objection, Plato points out--Socrates points out--that the\nsoul can be good or it could be evil, wicked. When the soul is good,\nwhen you've got somebody who has got their stuff together, we might\nspeak of them as having a harmonious soul. If the soul were to the body\nlike harmony is to the instrument and the soul can be harmonious, it\nwould seem as though we'd have to be able to talk about harmony being\nharmonious. So just as we can talk about the harmony of the soul, we'd\nhave to be able to--if the soul is like the harmony of the body--we'd\nhave to be able to talk about the harmony of the harmony. But we don't\ntalk about harmony of the harmony.\n\nI'm not quite sure what to make of this objection. This might be a\npoint where it would be well to remind ourselves of the fact that the\nsuggestion was never that the soul just literally is harmony. It's just\nsimilar to harmony, says the physicalist, in the way that harmony gets\nproduced by the body--by the instrument. In that same way, mind or\nmental activity gets produced by the body. We don't have to say that\neverything that's true of the mind is true of harmony and everything\nthat's true of harmony is true of the body--or the mind.\n\nStill, I think there's a bit more we can say in response to this\nobjection, and that's this: Just as it's true that we can talk about\nminds or souls being good or wicked, we can talk about different kinds\nof harmony. There are--Certain harmonies are sweeter than others; some\nof them are more jarring and atonal or discordant. Although we might\nnot normally talk about how harmonious the harmony is, it seems as\nthough harmonies can come in different sorts and different kinds. And\nthen, it turns out we really would have an analogy to the mind, which\ncan come in different sorts and different kinds. So I think this third\nobjection isn't really compelling either.\n\nFinally, Plato raises one more objection. He says, \"Look, the soul\nis capable of directing the body, bossing it around, and indeed capable\nof opposing the body.\" You know, your body might want that piece of\nchocolate cake, but your soul says, \"No, no. You're on a diet. Don't\neat it.\" Right? Your soul can oppose the body. But if the soul was just\nharmony of the body, how could it do that? After all, the\nharmoniousness of the harp can't affect what the harp does. All the\ncausal interaction is one way, as we might put it. In the case of the\nharp and the musicality and the melodiousness and the harmony, the\nphysical state of the harp causes the melodiousness to be the way it\nis. But the harmoniousness of the harp, doesn't ever change or alter or\ndirect the way the physical object the harp is.\n\nIn contrast, not only can the body affect the soul, the soul can\naffect the body. So that suggests it can't really be like harmony and\nthe harp after all. I think that's a pretty interesting objection.\nSince we do think, at least in the kind of position that we've been\ntaking for this class, that the soul can affect the body, we might ask,\nhow could it be that it's--that the physicalist view is right? If talk\nabout the mind is just a way of talking about what the body can do, how\ncan the abilities of the body affect the body itself?\n\nI think the answer to this objection is probably going to be\nsomething like, what's really going on when we talk about the soul\naffecting the body is that--when we say certain functions of the body\nare affecting the body--that certain mental functions are affecting the\nbody--how does this happen causally? Well, something like the physical\nparts of the body that underwrite, that lie beneath the proper\nfunctioning, the proper mental functioning of body, those are able to\nalter the other parts of the body.\n\nSo look, right now I'm telling by body, \"Wiggle my fingers.\" My soul\nis giving instructions to my body. How does that happen? That's my mind\ngiving instructions to my body. How does that happen on the physicalist\nview? Well, my mind giving instructions to my body, \"wiggle my\nfingers,\" is just one part of my body, my brain, giving instructions to\nanother part of my body, the muscles in my fingers. So, although we\ntalk about the mind altering the body, strictly what's going on there,\nsays the physicalist, is just one part of the body affecting another\npart of the body. Can we have something like that with a harp? Well,\nmaybe not. Right? Maybe the harp's too simple a machine to have one\npart of it affect another part of it in that way. Even if that were\ntrue, that wouldn't give us reason to reject the physicalist\nconception. It would just give us reason to think the harp's not\nvery much like the mind and the body. It's just the beginnings\nof a picture, of a physicalist picture.\n\nStill, even if we think about the harp and musicality, I think we\ncan see something analogous. Suppose I pluck a string on my harp,\nproducing a certain note. As we know, the vibrations of one string can\nset into play the other strings vibrating as well. And so, suddenly,\nwhat's happening in one part of the harp affects what's going on in\nother parts of the harp. The musicality of my playing a certain chord\non the harp may create certain kinds of overtones in the harp, setting\nthe harp vibrating in various other ways. Well, that would be\nanalogous--perhaps not a precise analogy, but at least a rough analogy\nto what goes on when my mind affects my body--to--if one part of my\nbody affects other parts of my body.\n\nSo, on the one hand, I want to give Plato a fair bit of credit for\ntaking the physicalist view seriously enough to try to criticize it.\nAnd since when he was writing there weren't the kind of complicated\nthinking machines that we've got nowadays, it's no criticism of Plato\nthat he used simple machines like musical instruments to try to think\nabout what a physicalist picture would look like. I want to give him\ncredit, but I also want to suggest that the objections that he raises\nto the physicalist view just don't succeed. All right.\n\nNow, there's one other argument that I want to consider in our\ndialogue. And after the appeal to the simplicity of the soul, there's a\nvery long complicated discussion about what constitutes an adequate\nexplanation, and Socrates gives some of his history there and talks\nabout what he's looking for in trying to find adequate explanations of\nthings. And these passages are very, very difficult and happily for our\npurposes we don't really need to go there.\n\nBefore the dialogue ends though, there's one further argument, which\nI'll dub, \"the argument from essential properties.\" Now again, it's\nimportant to bear in mind as we try to make sense of this passage that\nPlato is writing at a time when we don't have, we didn't have, all the\nconceptual apparatus that we have nowadays. We stand on his shoulders;\nwe've inherited some of the distinctions that he was the first to try\nto put into play. And so although, again, he's about to--I'm about to\nsketch or reconstruct an argument and claim that that the argument\ndoesn't actually work, this isn't really meant by way of being\ndismissive of Plato. I want to give him a tremendous amount of credit.\nHe's trying to see his way through a morass of issues that are still\nconfusing to us today, though I think we can see somewhat further than\nhe was able to see.\n\nAt any rate, the distinction we need to understand the final\nargument, is the distinction between an essential property and a\ncontingent property. An essential property is a property that a given\nobject must have; it always has as long as it exists at all. A\ncontingent property is a property that an object may have, may happen\nto have its entire existence, but could've existed without. So my car\nis blue. That's a contingent property of my car. I could take it to the\npaint shop and get it painted red, in which case it would be red. It\nwould no longer be blue, but the car would still exist. My car is blue,\nbut it could be red; it could exist as a red car. And even if I never,\nover the entire course of existence of my car, never get it painted, so\nthat from the moment it came into creation to the moment it gets\nsmashed it's always blue--still, we understand perfectly well the idea\nthat it could've been red. There's nothing incompatible with the idea\nthat this car exists and is red. So that's an example of a contingent\nproperty.\n\nAnd I might have a pencil, and the pencil is whole. And I never\nbreak it, but I could've broken it. That's a contingent property,\nwhether the pencil is whole or broken. I take a piece of metal; it's a\ncontingent property whether it's straight or bent. I bend it; now it's\nbent. I might straighten it back out; now it's straight. Many, many\nproperties are contingent properties. You're happy, you're sad, you're\nawake, you're asleep.\n\nBut some properties, in contrast, are essential properties. For the\nparticular thing that we're thinking about, it's not possible to have\nthat thing and not have the property in question. Plato gives the\nexample of fire and being hot. Fire is hot. That's a property that it's\ngot, but it's not a contingent property; it's an essential property.\nIt's not as though some fire is hot and some fire is cold or, \"Oh yes,\nit just happens that over the entire life of the fire the fire is hot,\nbut we could have made it cold.\" There's no such thing; there could be\nno such thing as cold fire. As long as you've got a bit of fire, it's\nhot. Take away the heat, you take away the fire, you destroy the fire.\nYou can't have cold fire. That's an example of an essential\nproperty.\n\nThat is to say, Plato sees, as indeed I take it we all see at least\nroughly, that there's some sort of distinction there, and he's trying\nto see his way clear on these matters. That remains a controversial\nquestion today--until today. Are there really essential properties in\nthe way we take there to be? If so, which properties are essential?\nWhich ones are contingent? Water is composed of H2O--that's\nits atomic structure. Is that an essential property of water? Could you\nhave something that was water without being composed of\nH2O--hydrogen and oxygen in that way? Well, some people say\nyes, some people say no--but most of us we want to say, \"Oh, there's an\nexample of an essential property. To be water, you must have that\natomic structure.\" All right. That's the thought.\n\nNow, armed with this distinction, Plato says, \"Here's an essential\nproperty for the soul. Wherever there's a soul, it's alive.\" Now, by\n\"alive,\" I take it Plato means it's thinking, or it's capable of\nthought. Wherever you've got a soul, you've got something capable of\nthought. I suppose one could try to resist this claim of Plato's, but I\nfind it reasonably plausible. I start thinking about minds, and I ask\nmyself, \"Could there be a mind that was incapable of thought?\" Maybe\nnot. Maybe that's just built into minds by definition. Just like you\ncouldn't have something that was fire without it being hot, you\ncouldn't have something that was a mind without it being capable of\nthought. It's important to say the word capable here. Right? It's not\nas though all minds always are thinking. I presume there are stretches\nduring the night when my mind is not thinking, not dreaming. Still,\nit's capable of thought even thought it's not thinking at the time. But\nyou say, \"No. Here's a mind that's not even capable of thought.\" I want\nto say, \"Then, it's just not a mind.\"\n\nSo all right, maybe being capable of thought is an essential\nproperty of the mind. Plato thinks about the mind in terms of souls, so\nmaybe being capable of thought is an essential property of the soul.\nAnd I think that's what Plato means when he suggests the mind is\nessential--the soul is essentially alive. It's a necessary property, as\nwe might put it, of the soul, that it's alive, that it's capable of\nthought. So I want to say, \"Not an implausible claim.\" Let's give it to\nSocrates.\n\nBut once we give it to Socrates, Plato thinks now he's pretty much\ndone. After all, think about what it means to say that something's got\nan essential property. Fire's got the essential property of being hot.\nIt means there are only two possibilities. Either you've got some fire\nand it will be hot, or the fire has been destroyed, it's been put out.\nThose are the only two possibilities. You either have--If heat is an\nessential property of fire, either you've got some fire and it's hot,\nor the fire no longer exists, it's been put out. There's no third\npossibility of a non-hot fire, of a cold fire. So, if you've got the\nclaim that life's an essential property of the soul, only two\npossibilities: either you've got the soul and it's alive--to wit, it's\ncapable of thought--or the soul's been destroyed.\n\nBut Plato thinks we can rule out that other possibility. How? Well,\nit's by thinking about this particular essential property. There's\nnothing in the idea that fire has the essential property of being hot\nto make us think it couldn't be destroyed, but there is something,\nPlato thinks, in the idea of being essentially alive to rule out the\npossibility of its being destroyed.\n\nIn fact, as you say the very words you begin to feel the force, the\npull of Plato's position. If the soul is essentially alive, if it's\nnecessarily alive, it's got to be alive. It can't be destroyed. That's,\nI think, at least the kind of argument that Plato means to put forward.\nHe does it in terms of the phrase, \"deathless.\" He says, I want to\nactually get this up here on the board [See Figure 9.1]. One--life is\nan essential property of the soul. But if you think about what that\nmeans, it follows that the soul is deathless. After all, if the soul\nis--If it's essentially alive, that means it can't be dead. So it's\ndeathless. But after all, anything that's deathless can't die. So the\nsoul cannot die, which is just to say it's indestructible. So, soul\ncan't be destroyed. Something like this seems to be Plato's argument.\nOne, life's an essential property of the soul, but we can just\nsummarize that by saying the soul is deathless. But if the soul is\ndeathless, it can't die. If it can't die, it can't be destroyed, it's\nindestructible. So the soul can't be destroyed. Remember, once we said\nthe soul was alive, there were only two possibilities. If the soul was\nessentially alive, either we have the soul, it's alive, capable of\nthought, or it's destroyed. But if the soul can't be destroyed, that\nleaves only the possibility the soul is alive, capable of thought.\nThat's just what Plato thinks; the soul will always exist, capable of\nthought.\n\nWell, it won't shock you to hear that I don't think this argument\nactually works. And I think where it goes wrong is there's a certain\nkind of ambiguity in the idea of being deathless. What does it mean to\nsay that something is deathless? I think there are two possible\ninterpretations of that phrase [See Figure 9.2]. If something is\ndeathless, then it can't be that--well, what? One possibility is, it\ncan't be that the soul exists and is dead. That's one possible\ninterpretation. To say that something is deathless means you'll never\nhave a soul that exists and the same time that it exists it's dead. But\nthere's a second possible interpretation of deathless. It can't be that\nthe soul was destroyed. It's very easy to confuse these two\ninterpretations of deathless, A and B. And basically, this is what I\nthink is going on with Plato. He's running back and forth between these\ntwo interpretations. If life is an essential property of the soul, then\nthat means we will never have, as it were, a soul in our hand that\nexists and is dead. Just in the same way that you'll never have a piece\nof fire in your hand, as it were, that exists and is cold. It can't\nhappen. Wherever you've got a soul, it is alive. So it's deathless in\nsense number, in sense A.\n\nSince wherever you've got a soul it must be alive, it couldn't be\nthe case that the soul exists and is dead. So it's deathless in sense\nA. But for all that, it could still be, logically speaking, that the\nsoul could be destroyed, just like a fire can be put out. We could\nimagine something that couldn't be destroyed. Then of course it would\nbe deathless in sense B, a much stronger sense of deathless. What Plato\nneeds, what Plato wants, is to convince us that the soul is deathless\nin sense B: It's true of the soul that it can't be that it was\ndestroyed. But all he's entitled to is sense A: You'll never have a\nsoul that exists and is dead, because being alive is an essential\nproperty of the soul. But the mere fact that where there's a soul it's\nalive, doesn't mean the soul couldn't be destroyed. Just like from the\nfact that where there's fire it's hot doesn't mean the fire can't be\ndestroyed.\n\nIt's, I think, pretty easy to get confused in thinking about these\nissues. It's difficult to see your way clearly to these two different\nnotions of deathless. It's difficult to get to the point where you can\nclearly use the language of essential properties without getting\nscrewed up. Still, I think that's what happened here. We grant Plato\nthe thought that the soul has an essential property of being alive;\nfrom this, it follows that where there's a soul it is alive, and hence,\nit's deathless in sense A. But once we start thinking about the\ncategory, the notion of being deathless, we're tempted to re-understand\nthat as being deathless in sense B, can't be destroyed. And that, I\nthink, doesn't follow.\n\nAll right. Where does that leave us? Plato's gone through a series\nof arguments for the immortality, the indestructibility of the soul,\nand I've argued that none of them work. Some of them are worth taking\nseriously. That's why we've spent the last week or so going over them.\nBut none of them, as far as I can see, are successful. And I hardly\nneed remind you that this comes on the heels of a previous week or two\nin which we talked about various other arguments for the very existence\nof an immaterial soul. And I've argued that none of those arguments\nwork either. As far as I can see then, the arguments that might be\noffered for the existence of an immaterial soul, let alone an immortal\nsoul, the arguments don't succeed. It's not that the idea of a soul is\nin any way silly; it's not that it's not worth thinking about. It's\nthat when we ask ourselves, \"Do we have any good reason to believe in\nan immaterial soul?\" and actually try to spell out what those reasons\nmight be, as we look more carefully we see the arguments are not very\ncompelling.\n\nSo I'm prepared to conclude there is no soul. There's no good reason\nto believe in souls. And I so I conclude--at least there's no good\nenough reason to believe in souls--and so I conclude there are\nnone.\n\nAnd this is the position that here on out I'm going to be assuming\nfor the rest of the class. I'm going to have us continue to think about\ndeath, but now think about death from the physicalist perspective.\nGiven the assumption that the body is all there is, that talk about the\nmind is just a way of talking about the abilities of the body to do\ncertain special mental activities. There are no extra things beyond the\nbody, no immaterial souls.\n\nNow, it wouldn't be unreasonable at this point to accuse me of\nbegging the question. After all, think about what I've done. I've put\nall of the burden of proof on the fan of souls. I've asked the dualist,\n\"Give me some reason to believe your position.\" And I've said the\narguments on behalf of dualism aren't very convincing. Don't I now\nneed, in fairness, to do the same thing for the physicalist? Don't I\nneed to turn to the physicalist and say, \"Give me some reason to\nbelieve that physicalism is true? Give me some reason to believe souls\ndon't exist.\" After all, I turned to the dualist and said, \"Give me\nsome reason to believe in souls.\" Those arguments didn't work. Don't I\nnow need to turn to the physicalist and say, \"Give me some reason\nnot to believe in souls? Prove that souls don't exist.\"\nIsn't that fair?\n\nSo let's pause and ask ourselves, how do you go about proving that\nsomething doesn't exist? Or, to put it in a slightly better way, when\ndo you need to prove that something doesn't exist? When we have\nexamples of things whose existence we don't believe in, how do we\ndecide when we're justified in disbelieving them? Take something like\ndragons. Let me assume that everybody in this class, in this room, does\nnot believe in the existence of dragons. How do I prove that there\naren't any dragons? I mean, there could be dragons. Couldn't there? But\nthere aren't any. We don't believe in dragons. So don't you need to\ndisprove the existence of dragons before you continue on your way of\nnot believing in them? I imagine nobody in this room believes in the\nexistence of Zeus, the Greek god. How do you disprove the existence of\nZeus? Don't we have an obligation to prove that Zeus doesn't exist? But\nhow could you do that?\n\nWell, unsurprisingly, I don't actually think you do have an\nobligation to disprove those things. That doesn't mean you don't have\nany obligations. You just have to be very careful about what the\nintellectual obligations come to. So back to dragons. What do we need\nto do for dragons? Well, the most important thing you need to do, to\njustify your skepticism about dragons, is to refute all of the\narguments that might be offered on behalf of dragons.\n\nMy son's got a book about dragons with some very nice photographs.\nSo, one of the things I need to do in order to justify my skepticism\nabout dragons is explain away the photographs, or the drawings, or what\nhave you. I need to explain why it is that we have pictures, even\nthough there really aren't any dragons. Well, some of these are just\ndrawings, and people were drawing things out of their imagination. The\nthings that look like photographs, nowadays with computer generated\ngraphics, you can make things that look like photographs, and given\nPhotoshop you can make things that look like pictures of just about\nanything that doesn't even exist.\n\nHow do I prove there aren't any unicorns? Well, I look at the\nvarious reported sightings of unicorns and I try to explain them away,\n\"Well, you know, it's the first time people, Europeans, saw the\nrhinoceros. It sort of reminded them of a horse with a big horn. And\nmaybe that's where the reports of rhinoceros came--or the various\nreports of the unicorn came from. The various unicorn horns that have\nbeen offered in various collections, upon examination by biologists\nturn out to be narwhal horns, horns from whales, and so forth and so\non.\" You look at each bit of evidence that gets offered on behalf of\nthe unicorn and you debunk it. You explain why it's not compelling. And\nwhen you're done, you're entitled to say, \"You know, as far as I can\ntell, there aren't any unicorns. As far as I can tell, there aren't any\ndragons.\" It's not as though you've got some obligation to look in\nevery single cave anywhere on the surface of the Earth and say, \"Oh, no\ndragons in there, no dragons in there, no dragons in there, no dragons\nin there, no dragons in there.\" You are pretty much justified in being\nskeptical about the existence of dragons once you've undermined the\narguments for dragons.\n\nNow, there might be something more that you could do. In at least\nsome cases, you can go on to argue the very idea of the kind of thing\nwe're talking about is impossible. It's not just--Take dragons again;\nit's not just that there's no good reason to believe in dragons. The\nvery idea of a dragon may be scientifically incoherent, at least given\nthe science as we understand it. I mean, dragons are supposed to breath\nfire. So that must mean they've got fire in their belly. But how does\nthe fire continue to exist in their belly, absent--lack of oxygen? Why\nisn't the fire in their belly busy burning and destroying the membranes\nof their stomach or whatever? All right, you could, I suppose, try to\nprove that dragons were scientifically impossible. And if you could,\nthen you'd have an extra reason to not believe in them. But it's not as\nthough you have to prove that something's impossible to be justified in\nnot believing in it. I don't think unicorns are impossible. I just\ndon't think there are any. Surely, there could be horses with a single\nlong horn growing out of their forehead. There just aren't any.\n\nSo armed with these ideas, come back to the discussion of souls. Do\nI, as a physicalist who does not believe in the existence of souls,\nimmaterial entities above and beyond the body, do I need to disprove\nthe existence of souls? \"Well, there's no soul here, no souls there.\"\nNo. What I need to do is to take a look at each argument that gets\noffered for the existence of a soul and rebut it--explain why those\narguments are not compelling. I don't need to prove that souls are\nimpossible. I just need to undermine the case for souls. If there's no\ngood reason to believe in souls, that actually constitutes a reason to\nbelieve there are no souls.\n\nNow, if you want to, you could go on and try to prove that souls are\nimpossible in the same way that maybe dragons are impossible. But I'm\nnot sure that I myself find such impossibility claims especially\npersuasive. I don't believe in the existence of souls, but that doesn't\nmean that I find the idea of an immaterial entity like the soul\nimpossible. Now, some people might say, \"Well, you know, it violates\nscience as we know it. It violates physics to have there be something\nimmaterial.\" But science is constantly coming around to believe in\nentities or properties that it didn't believe in previously. Maybe it\njust hasn't gotten around to believing in souls yet. Or if current\nscience rules out the possibility of souls, maybe we should say, \"So\nmuch the worse for current science.\"\n\nSo I'm not somebody who wants to say we can disprove the existence\nof souls. I don't think we can disprove them. I don't think the idea of\na soul is in any way incoherent. There are philosophers who've thought\nthat. I'm not one of them. But I don't think I need to disprove the\nexistence of a soul to be justified in not believing in it. Unicorns\naren't impossible, but for all that, I'm justified in thinking there\naren't any. Why? Because all the evidence for unicorns just doesn't add\nup to very convincing case. Souls are not impossible, but for all that,\nI think I'm justified in believing there aren't any. Why? Because when\nyou look for the--look at the arguments that have been offered to try\nto convince us of the existence of souls, those arguments just aren't\nvery compelling, or so it seems to me. So, from this point on out, I'll\nbe assuming the physicalist view is correct, and will be thinking about\nthe issues of death as they'd be understood from the physicalist point\nof view.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct10.html":{"url":"lct10.html","title":"Lecture 10","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 10 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 15, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: At the end of last class, I suggested\nthat from here on out I'm going to be assuming that there is no soul.\nI'm going to be discussing the issues that we turn to hereafter from\nthe perspective of the physicalist, the person who says that a person\nis basically just a fancy body--a body that can do certain special\ntricks, a body that can function in certain ways that we associate with\nbeing a person, a body that can P-function, as we put it.\n\nNow, I've given you my reasons for believing there are no souls.\nBasically, that the various arguments that might be offered for\nbelieving in souls don't seem very compelling upon examination, so\nthere's no good reason to posit this extra entity. For the most part,\nthen, I'm going to be putting aside soul talk. Periodically, I'll come\nback and talk about how some issue that we are considering might look\nfrom the perspective of somebody who does believe in souls. But, as I\nsay, for the most part, I'm going to be assuming there are no souls.\nFor those of you who still do believe in the existence of souls, I\nsuppose you could take a great deal of the discussion that follows as\nsome form of large conditional or subjunctive. If there were no souls,\nthen here's what we'd have to say. So although I'll be largely talking\nfrom the perspective of the physicalist, if you haven't become\nconvinced of the truth of physicalism, so be it. We'll at least explore\nwhat will we say about death if we've decided that people are basically\njust bodies?\n\nNow, you'll recall that at the start of the semester I said, in\nthinking about the question, could I survive my death? there were two\nbasic things we had to get clear on. First, we had to get clear on,\nwhat am I? What are my parts? That's why we spent the last several\nweeks worrying about the question, am I just a body? Am I a body and an\nimmaterial soul as well? Or perhaps, strictly speaking, just the soul?\nHaving looked at that question, we're now going to turn to the second\nbasic question, what would it be to survive? What would it be for a\nthing like that to continue to exist? Now, of course, we're going to\nask most particularly, what would it be for a thing like that to\nsurvive the death of the body? Could it even make sense for a person to\nsurvive the death of his body? You might think the answer to that is\nno, if we are physicalists, but in fact, it's not so clear the answer\nto that is no.\n\nBut in order to address that particular question--What is for me to\nsurvive the death of my body? Is that even a possibility or not?--we\nfirst have to get clear about the more general question, what is it for\nme to survive, period? Take the more familiar hum-drum case. Here I am\nlecturing to you today, Thursday. Somebody's going to be here, no\ndoubt, lecturing to you next week, next Tuesday. The question of\nsurvival can be asked about that very simple case. Is the person who's\ngoing to be lecturing to you on Tuesday the very same person as the\nperson who is standing in front of you lecturing to you now? Will that\nperson survive the weekend? I certainly expect to survive the weekend.\nBut what is it to survive the weekend? What is it?\n\nWe might say, look, we've already got the beginnings of an answer.\nFor me to survive until Tuesday, presumably is for there to be\nsomebody, some person alive lecturing to you on Tuesday, and--here's\nthe crucial point--for that person lecturing to you on Tuesday to be\nthe very same person as the person lecturing to you today, on Thursday.\nIf I were to be killed in a plane accident this weekend and there was a\nguest lecturer for you on Tuesday, there'd be somebody alive lecturing\nto you. But, of course, that wouldn't be me. So the question we want to\nget clear on is, what is it for somebody on Tuesday to be the same\nperson as the person here talking to you on Thursday? We can ask the\nquestion more grandly, about larger expanses of time. Suppose there's\nsomebody alive 40-odd years from now, in the year 2050. Could that be\nme? To ask, have I survived until 2050? is to ask, is that person who's\nalive in 2050 the very same person as the person who's standing here\nnow lecturing to you? What is it for somebody in the future to be the\nvery same person as this person who's here now today?\n\nNow, in thinking about this question, it's important not to\nmisunderstand what we're asking. Some of you may misunderstand what I'm\nasking. Some of you may want to say, \"Look, the person lecturing to you\nnow has at least a fair bit of his hair. He's got a beard. Let's\nsuppose that the person alive in 2050 is bald and bent over, has no\nbeard. How could they be the same person? One's got hair, one doesn't.\nOne's got a beard, one doesn't. One stands straight, one's crooked. It\ncan't be the same person.\" That's the mistake that it's important for\nus to get clear about. So I'm going to spend some time talking about\nexamples that I think we would not find puzzling, and work our way back\nup to the case of personal identity. So first I'm going to say some\nthings about identity across time--or indeed initially, identity across\nspace--with some familiar, hum-drum, material objects. So, let's\nstart.\n\nSuppose you and I are walking along and we see a train. So let me\ndraw the train first. I'm not a very good artist, but all right.\nThere's our train. We start walking. I point to the caboose. Let's make\nthis look more like a caboose, slightly more like a caboose. Just so it\ndoesn't look too much like the locomotive. [See Figure 10.1] I point to\nthe caboose and I say, \"Look at that train.\" And we're walking along,\nwe're walking along, we're walking along. We come to the end of the\ntrain and I point to the locomotive and I say, \"Wow! Look how long that\ntrain is! That's the very same train I pointed to five minutes ago.\nWe've been walking along it all this time.\"\n\nNow, imagine that you say--you wouldn't say anything as stupid as\nthis, but imagine that you said this--you say, \"This isn't the same\ntrain as the train we pointed to five minutes ago. After all, right now\nwhat you're pointing to is a locomotive, whereas five minutes ago what\nyou pointed to was a caboose. A caboose isn't the same thing as a\nlocomotive. How could you possibly say it's the same thing? Who could\npossibly make a mistake like that? The locomotive's got smoke coming\nout of it. The caboose doesn't. And so forth and so on. There's a lot\nof differences between the two. How could you make such a silly\nmistake?\"\n\nWell, of course, what I would then want to say to you is, no,\nactually, you're the one who's making the mistake. I agree, of course,\nthat a locomotive is not the same thing as a caboose. But I wasn't\nclaiming that it was. Rather, initially when we started our walk, I\npointed to a caboose, but by pointing to the caboose, I picked out a\ntrain. I said, \"Look at that train.\" And what I was referring to wasn't\njust the caboose, but the whole, long, extended-through-space object,\nthe train, of which the caboose was just a part. And when--At the end\nof our walk when I pointed to a locomotive and said, \"Look at that\ntrain,\" by pointing to the locomotive, I was picking out a train, an\nentire train. This long, extended-through-space object, the train. And\nwhen I said, \"This train that I'm pointing to now is the very same\ntrain as the train I pointed to five minutes ago,\" I'm not saying what\nis certainly false. I'm not saying the locomotive is the same thing as\nthe caboose. Rather, what I'm saying is, the entire\nextended-through-space train that I'm pointing out now is the same\ntrain as the entire extended-through-space train that I picked out five\nminutes ago. And that claim, far from being false, is true.\n\nNow, as I say, none of us would make that mistake. But it's a\ntempting mistake if you're not being careful. And that mistake might\nmislead us if we start thinking about the personal identity case. But\nlet's continue with the train for a bit. Suppose, as we're taking our\nwalk, part of the train isn't visible. There's a large warehouse that's\nblocking the view. [See Figure 10.2] We're walking along the way. We\nsee a caboose. I say, \"Ha! There's a train.\" Then for a while we're\nwalking, we don't see anything because all you can see is the\nwarehouse. And then after we get past the warehouse, a very long,\nblock-long warehouse, I see a locomotive and I say, \"Hey look. There's\na train.\" And then I ask you, \"Do you think this is the same train as\nthe train we pointed to before?\" Now again, it's important not to\nmisunderstand that question. That question is not asking, is the\nlocomotive that we're pointing to now the same as the caboose that we\npointed to earlier? No, of course not. The locomotive's not the same as\nthe caboose. But that's not what I'm asking. What I'm asking rather is,\nremember earlier when I pointed to the caboose?\" In doing so, and I\nstarted talking about a train, I was picking out some entire\nextended-through-space train. Right now, in pointing to a locomotive,\nI'm picking out not just the locomotive. I mean to be talking about an\nentire train. Some entire extended-through-space train. And I'm asking\nnot about the locomotive and the caboose, but rather I'm asking about\nthe trains that I pick out by means of the locomotive and caboose. Are\nthey the same train? And the answer is, \"Don't know; can't tell. The\nbuilding's blocking the view.\"\n\nSuppose we had x-ray vision and could see through the building. Then\nthe answer would be, \"Well look, if what we've got is something like\nthis [drawing], then of course, we do have one single train.\" [See\nFigure 10.3] The extended-through-space train I picked out at the end\nof our walk is the same as the extended-through-space train that I\npicked out at the beginning of our walk. But it might not turn out that\nway. It might turn out if I had x-ray vision, that what I'd see is this\n[drawing]. [See Figure 10.4] Then the answer would be, \"Ah, there's not\none train here, but two trains.\" The extended-through-space train that\nI'm picking out when I point to the locomotive turns out to be a\ndifferent train from the extended-through-space train I picked out when\nI pointed to the caboose. I don't have x-ray vision. I don't know which\nof these metaphysical hypotheses is the correct one. All right, easy\nenough with trains. We know how it works with trains.\n\nNow let's talk about something not a whole lot more\ncomplicated--cars. I used to have a car I bought in 1990. My ability to\ndraw cars is even worse than my ability to draw trains. There's my car\nin 1990. It was new. It was sparkly. Then I drove it for some years and\nI got some dents and so forth and so on. Here's a smile. By 1996 or\n2000, it wasn't looking so good. The sparkle had gone. It had a couple\nof dents. That was the car in 2000. By 2006, it had a lot of dents,\n2006, when it finally died. [See Figure 10.5]\n\nAll right, now we all understand the claim that the car I had in\n2006 was the very same car as the car I had in 1990. Of course, again,\nyou've got to be careful not to misunderstand what's being said. We all\nknow that in 2006 the car had a lot of scratches and had gotten banged\nin on one side and pretty sorry looking in terms of the scrapes and the\npaint job and the rust. Whereas, the car in 1990, new and shiny and\nsmooth. You might say the 2006 car stage is obviously not the same\nthing as the 1990 car stage. That's like thinking that the locomotive's\nthe same thing as the caboose. But when I say it's the same car, I\ndon't mean to be talking about car stages. I mean to be talking about a\nsingle thing that was extended through time.\n\nThere I am, proud owner of my new car in 1990 and I say, \"This is a\ncar. It's a car that will exist for more than a few minutes. It's a car\nthat will exist for years and years and years,\" though at the time I\ndidn't realize it was going to last 16 years or longer. When I refer to\nmy car--as opposed to what we could dub the car stage or the car\nslice--when I refer to the car in 1990, I mean to be talking about the\nentire extended-through-time object. In 2006, when I point to that sad\nheap and talk about, \"I've had that car for 16 years.\" Well, I haven't\nhad that car stage for 16 years. That car stage or that car slice, if\nwe wanted to talk about it that way, has only been around for however\nlong, months, years, a year. It hasn't been around for 16 years. But\nwhen I talk about that car, I'm picking not just the current slice or\nthe current stage of the car, but the entire extended-through-time\nobject. When I say, \"That's the very same car I've had for 16 years,\" I\nmean, \"Think of the object extended through time that I'm picking out\nby pointing to the current slice. That's the very same\nextended-through-time object that I picked out 16 years ago by pointing\nto what was then the current slice. The slices aren't the same; the\ncar is the same. It's the very same car.\"\n\nWell, now let's imagine a somewhat more difficult case. At the end\nof 2006, my engine failed. I sold the car to a dealer, junk dealer.\nSuppose that in 2010 I see a car in the junk lot and it looks familiar\nto me. [See Figure 10.6] I say, \"Whoa! That's my car.\" Is it or isn't\nit my car? This is sort of like the case with the factory blocking the\nview. 1990 to 2006, very easy. Saw the car every day in my garage. But\nhere is a four-year--Instead of a factory blocking my view, it's the\nmists of time blocking my view. And I ask, \"Same car or not?\" Again, by\nthis time, I imagine you don't need to be warned, but let me just warn\nyou a couple more times. I'm not asking, \"Is the car stage, the 2010\ncar stage, the same car stage as the 2006 car stage? Maybe not. Maybe\nobviously not. I'm asking rather, in pointing to the 2010 car stage, I\nmean to be picking out an entire extended-through-time entity, the car.\nAnd I'm asking, \"Is that the very same extended-through-time entity as\nthe extended-through-time entity that I used to own?\" I wonder. And the\nanswer is, \"Don't know.\" The mists of time are blocking my view. I\ndon't know the answer. But we know what the possibilities are. One\npossibility is that indeed it's the very same--I won't draw it all,\n2008 and so forth. It could be the very same car. If we knew what it\ntook to have the various stages of a car add up to the very same car,\nthen that would be one possibility. [See Figure 10.7]\n\nBut there might be a different possibility. It could have been that\nafter I sold it to the junk dealer, he crushed it, turned it into a\nheap of metal and that was the end of my car. And the car I'm seeing on\nthe dealer's lot in 2010 might be some other car with its own history.\n[See Figure 10.8] What we're wondering about is, is there a\nsingle--well, here's a piece of jargon--is there a single \"space-time\nworm\" here or are there two? When I look at the car in 2010 and say,\n\"There's a car. I wonder if it's the same car,\" I'm asking about this\nthing that's extended--well, obviously through space, since cars take\nup some space--and through time. Looks a bit like a worm. So\nphilosophers call them space-time worms. Is the space-time worm that\nmakes up this car the same space-time worm as the one that made up my\ncar? One worm there or two? And the answer might be, \"Don't know, need\nto have more facts.\" But at least that's what the question is.\n\nNow metaphysically, there's different ways of trying to pose the set\nof issues that I've begun to talk about. Should we say, as we might say\nwith the train, the train is made up out of the various cars, the\nlocomotive, the caboose, and the intervening cars? So the train--that's\nthe way we normally think about trains, at least the way I normally\nthink about trains--the train's a bit like a sandwich, right? The\nmetaphysically fundamental things are the caboose, the locomotives, the\nintervening trains. If they're glued together in the right way, they\nmake up a train. What's the right kind of metaphysical glue for trains?\nWell, it's being connected with those little locks.\n\nThat may or may not be the right way to think about what I've been\ncalling car stages or car slices. On some metaphysical views, you might\nsay, just exactly like with the train, the car stages are the\nmetaphysically fundamental things and a car, something extended through\ntime, is glued together like a sandwich from the car stages. And then,\nwe might worry about what's the relevant metaphysical glue for cars. On\nother metaphysical views, no what's really prior is the car itself, and\ntalking about car stages is a certain convenience, a kind of way of\nchopping up the fundamental thing, the car. So, to use an analogy that\nI think David Kaplan, a philosopher at UCLA offers, it's as though you\nhave to think of it more like a bologna or salami that you can slice.\nIf--For certain purposes you can talk about slices, but the fundamental\nthing's the salami. All right.\n\nIn thinking about cars, should we say that the fundamental thing is\nthe car stages and they get put together like a sandwich to make cars?\nOr should we think that the fundamental thing is the car extended\nthrough time and it can be sliced up to make car stages? For our\npurposes, I think we won't have to go there. It doesn't really matter.\nAs long as we're comfortable talking about entire space-time worms, the\ncars, and the slices or the stages. We don't have to ask which is\nmetaphysically prior. You should also notice that- I should also\nmention that there are other metaphysical views about what goes on when\nan object exists over time. I've been here helping myself to the\nsuggestion that we should think about extension over time analogously\nto the way we think about extension over space. That's why I started\nwith a spatial example, the train, and moved to the temporal example,\nthe car. And there are those philosophers who think that's exactly the\nright way to think about it and those philosophers that think no, no,\nthat's misleading. When an object is extended over time, really the\nentire object's right there at every single moment. These are\ninteresting and difficult questions. But again, I think for our\npurposes, we don't have to go there.\n\nSo I will help myself to this language of space-time worms, objects\nthat extend not only over space but also over time. And distinguish the\nentire worm from the various slices or stages that either make up the\nworm or that we could slice the worm into. The point that I've been\nemphasizing is, well first point, of course, has been, \"Don't confuse\nthe stages with the entire space-time worm.\" The stages can differ\nwithout the entire space-time worm being a different worm. Second\nquestion I've hinted at that we're about to turn to, not literally turn\nto at the moment, but shortly we'll turn to is, \"What's the relevant\nglue?\" What makes two stages, stages of the very same thing? In the\ncase of trains, as I say, it's fairly obvious. What is it in the case\nof cars? What makes the 1990 car stage a stage in the very same car,\nthe extended through space and time worm car, as the 2006 stage? What's\nthe metaphysical glue that glues these stages together? And the answer,\nnot that there aren't puzzles about it, but the answer is roughly,\n\"It's the very same car if it's the very same hunk of metal and plastic\nand wires.\"\n\nThere was the car. A car is just some metal and plastic, rubber. And\nthat very same hunk continued into 2000 and it continued into 2006. The\nglue, the key to identity across time for cars, is being the same hunk\nof stuff. Now, that doesn't mean it's got to be the same atom for atom.\nWe know that's not true. Look, think about my steering wheel. Every\ntime I grabbed the steering wheel to drive, I wore away thousands of\natoms. You can lose some atoms and still be the very same steering\nwheel. Every now and then, I'd replace the tires on my car. But for all\nthat, it was the same hunk of stuff.\n\nNow this raises an interesting issue. How many changes of the\nconstituent parts can you have and still be the same hunk of stuff? If\nthis was a class in which we were going to worry about the general\nproblem of identity across time, this would be a problem we'd have to\ndirectly face. But since we are only looking at enough of the problem\nof identity to get to the question that we really want to think about,\nthe nature of personal identity across time, I'm not going to pursue\nthat. I just want to flag the thought that you can be the very same\nhunk of stuff, even if some of the constituent atoms have changed along\nthe way. And even bigger parts. You can replace the headlights and\nstill be the same hunk of stuff. At any rate, that's what's gone on in\nthe car case, same hunk of stuff 1900-2006. And when I see the car on\nthe junk dealer's yard in 2010 and ask, \"Is that my car or not?\" the\nanswer lies in--if only we could know--is that the same hunk of stuff\nor not? That's what the key, the metaphysical glue is, being the same\nhunk of stuff.\n\nAll right, let's turn now to the case we really wonder about,\npersonal identity. Here's somebody lecturing to you in 2007, Shelly\nKagan. We imagine there's somebody in 2050 and we ask, \"Is that Shelly\nKagan?\" We'll call him \"Mr. X.\" [See Figure 10.9] We ask, \"Is that the\nsame person or not?\" Now again, at this point you're not going to be\ntempted by the mistake. I'm not asking, \"Is this person stage Mr. X the\nsame person stage as SK 2007?\" Obviously not. SK 2007 has still got his\nhair, has the beard, stands up more or less straight. Mr. X is bald,\ndoesn't have a beard. I suppose I should have drawn him bent. Can I do\nthat? A little cane. I'm not asking, \"Is the person stage Mr. X the\nsame as the person stage SK 2007?\" Sounds like a computer or something.\nGet the SK 2007! I'm not asking that. I'm asking, I'm saying, \"Look,\nwhen you look at the current stage, the current person slice and think\nabout the entire extended-through-time entity, the person that makes up\nShelly Kagan, or that is Shelly Kagan, is that the very same person as\nthe extended-through-time person that you got in mind when you point to\nthe Mr. X 2050?\"\n\nThe stages are obviously different. But by looking at the stages, we\npick out a space-time worm that makes up a person. And we're asking,\n\"Is that the very same space-time worm as the one we picked out\npreviously or a different space-time worm than the one we picked out\npreviously?\" And the answer, presumably, is going to be, \"Well it\ndepends on getting clear on whether the stages are glued together in\nthe right metaphysical way.\" And so, what we'd like to know is, well,\nwhat does it take for two person stages to make up or be part of the\nvery same extended-through-time person? What's the metaphysical glue\nthat underlies being a single extended-through-time person? What's the\nkey to personal identity? If we could get clear about what the answer\nto that metaphysical question, the key to personal identity, we'd at\nleast know what we needed to find out to answer the question, \"Is this\none person or two?\" Are the pieces glued together in the right way?\n\nDifferent question, the question that we're ultimately hoping to get\nan answer to. Could I survive my death? Well look, think again about\nthe question we started with. Could I survive the weekend? To survive\nthe weekend, there's got to be somebody who's alive, some person on\nTuesday and that person's got to be the very same person as the person\nyou're looking at now, you're thinking about now. Or to put it in terms\nof stages, that person's got to be--that stage, that slice has to be\npart of the very same extended-through-time space-time worm as this\nstage is. They've got to be glued together in the right way. We can't\ntell whether that's true until we know what the glue is. But at least\nwe anticipate that, well, there will be somebody here on Tuesday who is\nglued together in that way, the right way, whatever that turns out to\nbe. The stages will be glued together in the right way.\n\nSuppose I asked then, \"Will I survive my death?\" All right, so I'm\ngoing to be optimistic. I'm going to assume that I make it to 2040.\n2040‚Ä¶ I won't even be 90 yet. That's not too wildly optimistic. It's\noptimistic, but not wildly optimistic. So here's the SK 2040. We know\nthat there's an extended through space and time, space-time worm, a\nperson. Then let's suppose, sadly, 2041 my body dies. And I ask, \"Could\nI survive my death, that is to say, the death of my body?\" Well, we\nwant to know, after 2041, let's say 2045, is there somebody who's a\nperson, call him Mr. X. Could it be the case that there'd be a person\nin 2045, after the death of my body in 2041, could it be the case that\nthere's a person who is part of the very same space-time worm that\nyou're thinking about right now? Could that be or not? [See Figure\n10.10] We can't answer that question until we are clearer about what\ndoes it take to have identity across time. What's the key to personal\nidentity? What's the metaphysical glue? Once we get clear about what\nthe relevant metaphysical glue is, we'll be in a position to start\nasking, \"Could this happen or not?\"\n\nAll right, that's the question I want to turn to, then. What are the\npossible positions on this question? What's the key to personal\nidentity? What's it to be the very same person? As we might put it\nsomewhat misleadingly, what is it for \"two\" people to really be the\nsame single extended-through-time person?\n\nSuppose we believed in souls. Then here would be a natural proposal.\nThe metaphysical key to personal identity is having the very same soul.\nSo suppose I was a dualist. I'd say, \"Look, you're looking at a body,\nbut connected in this intimate way with this body is a particular soul,\nthe soul of Shelly Kagan. What makes it true that the person lecturing\nto you next Tuesday is Shelly Kagan, the very same person, what makes\nthat true is that it's the very same soul. As long as this soul is here\nagain on Tuesday, It'll be Shelly Kagan. If it's a different soul, it's\nnot Shelly Kagan.\" That's the natural thing to suggest if we believe in\nthe soul view. The key to personal identity--not the only thing a soul\ntheorist can say, but the natural thing for a soul theorist to say--the\nkey to personal identity is having the very same soul. Same soul, same\nperson. Different soul, different person.\n\nImagine that God or a demon or what have you, for whatever perverse\nreason, severs the ordinary connection between my body and my soul and\nthen reconnects the wires, as it were, so that there's a different soul\nanimating and controlling this body on Tuesday. For whatever perverse\nreasons, maybe to make some sort of philosophical point, that person\ndecides to come in anyway on Tuesday and lecture to you about\nphilosophy. According to the view that we're taking, which we'll now\ncall the soul view, according to the soul view, it won't be me\nlecturing to you on Tuesday. Why not? Because we've just stipulated\nit's not the same soul. It's a different soul. The key to personal\nidentity, according to the soul theory of personal identity, the key to\npersonal identity is having the same soul.\n\nWhen I ask myself, \"Will I survive the weekend?\" what I'm asking is,\n\"Will my soul still be around come Tuesday?\" As long as my soul still\nexists and is functioning, it's still me. I'm still around. In\nfact--peeking ahead of course, and this is why we are often drawn to\nsoul views--even if my body dies, as long as my soul continues to\nexist, I continue to exist. The key to personal identity, according to\nthe soul view, is having the same soul. As long as my soul continues to\nexist, it's still me, whether or not my body's still alive. And it's\nprecisely for this reason that at least the soul, belief in the soul,\ncombined with the soul theory of personal identity, holds out the\npossibility of surviving my death. We may not know that the soul will\ncontinue to exist after the destruction of the body, but at least it\nseems like a possibility. Plato of course, as we know, tried to argue\nthat we could know, that there was--there were good grounds for\nbelieving the soul would continue to exist. I've said I don't find\nthose grounds so convincing. But even if we didn't think we could show\nthat the soul would continue to exist, at least it could, it\nwould make perfect sense to think about it continuing to exist. And so\nI could survive the death of my body.\n\nIn contrast, it looks--Prospects don't look so promising for\nsurviving my death of my body if we don't believe in dualism, if we're\nphysicalists. If a person's just a P-functioning body, how could it be\nthat after the death of his body he's still around? Well, we'll say\nmore about that a little bit later.\n\nCome back to the soul view. It's me as long as it's the same soul.\nIt's not me if it's a different soul. Now consider the following\npossibility. Suppose that over the weekend, at 3:00 a.m., Saturday\nnight, Sunday morning, while I'm asleep, God replaces my soul with a\ndifferent soul, hooks it up to the body, gives that soul, that\nreplacement soul, all of my memories, all of my beliefs, all of my\ndesires, all of my intentions. Somebody wakes up Sunday morning and\nsays, \"Hey, it's a great day. Wonderful to be alive. I'm Shelly Kagan.\nGot to get to work.\" Whatever it is. Says \"I'm Shelly Kagan\"; but he's\nnot. According to the soul view, he's not. Because according to the\nsoul theory of personal identity, to be me that person's got to have my\nsoul. And in this story, he doesn't have my soul. My soul got\ndestroyed, let's suppose, 3:00 a.m. Sunday morning. A new soul got\ncreated. It's not me. There's a person there, all right. It's a person\nthat doesn't have a very long history. Maybe he'll go on to have a long\nhistory. But it's a different extended through space and time person\nthan the one you're thinking about right now. Because, according to the\nsoul view, to be me it's got to have the same soul and we just\nstipulated, not the same soul.\n\nThink about what that means. If God were to replace my soul Saturday\nnight, I die. And the thing that wakes up Sunday isn't me. Of course,\nhe'd think he was me. He'd think to himself, \"I'm the very same person\nwho was lecturing about philosophy last week.\" But he'd be wrong. It\nisn't the same person, because it's not the same soul. He'd be wrong\nand--notice this--there'd be no way at all he could tell. He could\ncheck his beliefs. He can check his desires. He can check his memories.\nBut that's not the key to personal identity, according to the soul\nview. The key to personal identity, according to the soul view, is\nhaving the very same soul. You can't check that. You can't see the soul\nto see if it's the same one. So if this were to happen to him, he\nwouldn't be Shelly Kagan, the person who'd been lecturing last week.\nBut there'd be no way at all he could know that.\n\nAnd now the question you would need to ask yourself is, how do you\nknow this didn't happen to you last night? You woke up this morning\nthinking, I'm the very same person--Joe, Linda, Sally, whatever it\nis--the very same person who was in class yesterday. How do you know?\nHow could you possibly know? If God replaced your soul with a new one,\ndestroyed the old one, gave the new one all the old memories, beliefs,\ndesires, goals, and so forth, that person who was in class last week,\nyesterday, died. The person who's here now hasn't been around 10 years,\n20 years, what have you. You were born a few hours ago. And there'd be\nno way at all that you could possibly tell.\n\nHow do you know, not only that it didn't happen to you last night,\nhow do you know something like this doesn't happen every single night,\nevery hour on the hour, every minute, every second? God whips out the\nold soul, destroys it, puts in a new one with--Maybe souls only last\nfor a minute and a half. If that was happening, then people don't last\nvery long. Bodies may last 20 years, 50 years, 80 years, 100 years, but\npeople would only last an hour or, if it's every minute substitution, a\nminute. And you'd never possibly be able to tell.\n\nNow these worries were raised by John Locke, the great British\nphilosopher, and he thought, this is too big a pill to swallow. This is\ntoo big a bullet to bite. We can't take seriously the suggestion that\nthere's no way at all to tell whether it was still me from the one day\nto the next, from one hour to the next, from one minute to the next,\njust not plausible. It's not that there's anything incoherent about\nthis view. It doesn't say anything logically contradictory about this\nview. You just have to ask yourself, \"Could this really be what\npersonal identity is all about? That there'd be no way at all to tell\nwhether I've survived from one minute to the next, from one hour to the\nnext?\" Locke thought no, you couldn't possibly take this view seriously\nif you thought about what it meant.\n\nNotice, this is not an argument that souls don't exist. If you find\nthis argument convincing, what it's an argument for is the claim that\neven if souls do exist, they may not be the key to personal identity.\nAnd so what we have to ask ourselves is, what's the alternative? What\nbetter suggestion is there for what we could point to as the\nmetaphysical glue, the key to personal identity? And that's the\nquestion that we'll take up next time.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct11.html":{"url":"lct11.html","title":"Lecture 11","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 11 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 20, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Last time, we turned to the question\nof what the metaphysical key to personal identity might be. What makes\nit be the case that one person, some person that exists in the future,\nis the same person as me. The first approach to this that we considered\nwas the soul theory of personal identity: the key to being the same\nperson is having the same soul. Same soul, same person. Different soul,\ndifferent person. And the difficulty with that approach, even if we\nbracket the question whether or not there are souls, the difficulty\nwith that approach was that it seems as though the soul could\nconstantly be changing while the personality, as we might call it,\nstays the same. I have the same beliefs, memories, desires, goals,\npreferences and so forth. But the soul underneath it all keeps being\nswapped every five minutes. If the soul theory of personal identity\nwere right, that would not be me. I would be--Every five minutes that\nperson would die and we'd have a new person, despite having the same\npersonality.\n\nMost of us find that a rather difficult thing to believe, that the\nperson could be constantly changing in this way, without having any way\nat all to tell. And if we're not willing to accept that implication, it\nseems as though we need to reject \"the soul theory of personal\nidentity.\" Now, I use this cumbersome phrase because, of course, I'm\nnot here talking about rejecting the existence of souls. What I'm\nconsidering right now is the question whether sameness of soul is the\nkey to being the same person. And this is a--There's a logical\ndistinction here that's worth drawing. Even if you believe in souls,\nyou don't have to say that having the very same soul is the key to\nbeing the very same person. And trivially, of course, if you don't\nbelieve in souls, if you don't believe that souls exist, that you\ncertainly can't appeal to the existence of souls, the continuity of\nsoul, the sameness of soul, as the key to personal identity.\n\nBut we might then ask, \"Well what's the alternative?\" Now, the\nnatural alternative is to say, \"The key to being the same person is not\nthe sameness of the soul, whether or not it exists, but rather having\nthe very same body.\" And again, although I'm not going to go on and on\nabout this point, it's worth noticing that even if you do believe that\nsouls exist, nothing stops you from accepting the body theory of\npersonal identity. Nothing rules out the possibility that having the\nvery same body is the key to being the very same person over time. Even\nif you believe in souls, you can accept the body theory. And it\ncertainly looks as though if you don't believe in souls, you have to\naccept the body theory of personal identity. Now, as it turns out, that\nappearance is deceptive. There are still other alternatives open to the\nphysicalist, but let's come to that other alternative later.\n\nLet's take a few minutes and consider the nature of the body theory,\nthe body theory of personal identity. On this theory, of course, the\nsecret to being the same person is having the same body. So when we\nask, well you remember last lecture I was talking about how there'd be\nsomebody here lecturing to you, philosophy, on Tuesday. Well, here\nsomebody is. Is that the same person? Is the person who's lecturing to\nyou now the same person as the person who was lecturing to you before?\nAccording to the body theory, the answer is--turns on the question,\n\"Well, is this the same body as the lump of flesh and bone that was\nhere last week?\" If it is--and by the by it is--if it is, then it's the\nsame person. So am I the person who was lecturing to you last week?\nYes, I am, because it's the very same body. That's what the body theory\nsays.\n\nAnd unlike souls, where it's all rather mysterious how you could\ntell whether soul swapping was taking place or not, it's not all that\nmysterious how we check out to see whether the same body's been around.\nEven though you didn't do it, you could have snuck into my house,\nwatched my body go to sleep, get up in the morning, followed the body\naround over the course of the day, see it go to sleep again. You could\nhave tracked that body through space and time and said, \"Hey look. It's\nthe very same body.\" In the same way that we are able to track in\nprinciple cars, our earlier example, and talk about yeah, it's the same\nhunk of metal and wire and rubber and plastic. This is the same hunk,\nsame body. All right, same body, same person. That's the body theory of\npersonal identity.\n\nNow, if we accept the body theory, then of course if we turn to the\nquestion, \"Could I survive my death?\" Could I survive the death of my\nbody?\" at first glance, it looks as though the answer's going to have\nto be, \"Well, of course not.\" Because when my body dies, then, oh\neventually the body begins to decay. It decomposes, turns into\nmolecules which get absorbed into the soil or what have you. This may\ntake years or decades or even centuries, but my body no longer exists\nafter death of my body. And so how could I survive the death of my\nbody, if for me to survive the death of my body, there's got to be\nsomebody who's me, and if being me requires it being the same body, my\nbody would have to still be around, but it's not. That's what it looks\nlike at first glance.\n\nBut at second glance we see that there's at least a logical\npossibility of surviving the death of my body. All it takes is for my\nbody to be put back together. Bodily resurrection. Now I'm not going to\nhere pursue the question of, \"Do we believe bodily resurrection occurs\nor will occur?\" I'll note that there have been religious traditions\nthat have taught and believed in this possibility. In particular, it's\nprobably worth mentioning that early Christians believed in something\nlike the body theory of personal identity and believed in bodily\nresurrection that would happen on Judgment Day. We can certainly\nunderstand the possibility that God would perform a miracle, put the\nmolecules back together, turn the body back on. Same body, same person,\ncome Judgment Day. That's the possibility. So it's at least worth\nemphasizing the fact that even if we don't believe in souls, we could\nstill believe in the possibility of surviving one's death, the death of\none's body, if we're willing to believe in bodily resurrection. Well,\nthat's how it looks.\n\nNow let's take a harder look. Talking that way assumes that when you\nput the body back together, when God puts the body back together on\nJudgment Day, that that's still my body. Is that right? I'm inclined to\nthink it is right. If God gathers up all the various molecules that had\ncomposed my body, reassembles them in the right order, putting this\ncalcium molecule next to that hydrogen molecule and so forth and so on,\nreassembles them in the right way--obviously if what He makes out of my\nbody's molecules is a Cadillac, then that's not my body--but if He puts\nthem together in the right way, that seems like it should be my\nbody.\n\nSo here's an analogy to give you a sense of what's going on. Suppose\nI take my watch to the jeweler because it stopped working. And in order\nto clean it and fix it, repair it, what the jeweler does is he takes it\napart. He takes the rust off of the gears, if there are still gears in\nwatches. Imagine it's an old stop watch. And he cleans all the pieces\nand buffs them and polishes them and then reassembles the whole thing.\nAnd a week later, I come back and ask, \"Where's my watch?\" And he hands\nit to me. Well, all well and good.\n\nNow imagine some metaphysician saying, \"Wait a minute, buster. Not\nso quick. That's not my watch. Admittedly, it's composed of all the\nvery same pieces that made up my watch. Admittedly, all these pieces\nare in the very same order as my watch, but still that's not my watch.\"\nOn the contrary, it seems to me the right thing to say about that\nexample is, \"No, that is my watch.\" My watch was disassembled for a\nperiod of time. Perhaps we should say my watch didn't exist during that\nperiod of time. But it got put back together. Now that's my watch. If\nthat's the right thing to say about the watch--and it does seem to me\nto be the right thing to say about the watch--then God could presumably\ndo the same thing on Judgment Day. He could take our molecules, which\nhad been scattered, put them back together and say, \"Ha! That's your\nbody.\" And if the body theory of personal identity is right, well, that\nwould be me. So it seems to me.\n\nBut there's a different example that we have to worry about as well,\nwhich argues against this proposal that the body could decompose and\nthen be recomposed. This is an example that's due to Peter van Inwagen.\nHe's a contemporary metaphysician, teaches at Notre Dame. Suppose that\nmy son builds a tower out of wooden blocks. We have a set of wooden\nblocks at home. Suppose that he builds some elaborate tower. It's very\nimpressive. And he says, \"Please show it to mom when she comes home.\"\nAnd he goes to bed. And I'm very good. I'm cleaning up the house after\nhe goes to bed and oops, I knock over the tower. I say, \"Oh my god,\nhe's going to be so angry. I promised him I'd be careful.\" So what I do\nis I take the blocks and I put them back together, building a tower in\nthe very same shape and the very same structure, the very same order as\nthe tower that my son had built. And in fact I'm so careful--perhaps\nthe blocks are numbered--I'm so careful that every block is in exactly\nthe same position as in the case where my son built it.\n\nAll right, I rebuild or I build this tower and my wife comes home\nand I say, \"Look what our son built. This is the tower that our son\nbuilt.\" Ah, that doesn't sound right. That's not the tower that our son\nbuilt. That's a tower that I built. This is a duplicate tower. Sure, if\nmy son were to wake up and I didn't tell him, he wouldn't know that it\nwas a duplicate. But when you take a wooden block tower apart and then\nput the pieces back together, piece for piece, duplicate, you don't\nhave the very same tower that you started out with. That's what van\nInwagen says and, I've got to admit, sounds right to me. If I were to\npoint to that tower and say, \"Ari built that,\" I'd be saying something\nfalse. \"That's the very same tower that Ari built.\" No, I'd be saying\nsomething false.\n\nSo van Inwagen concludes, if you have an object and you take it\napart and then put it all back together again, you don't have the very\nsame object that you started out with. So even if Judgment Day were to\ncome, and God were to reassemble the molecules and resurrect the body,\nit's not the very same body that you started out with. And if having\nthe very same body is the key to personal identity, it's not the same\nperson. Come Judgment Day, we've got a duplicate of me, but we don't\nhave me. That's what van Inwagen would say, if that's the way bodily\nresurrection would work.\n\nI don't know, theology aside, I don't know what to say about the\nmetaphysical questions. When I think about the tower case, I do find\nmyself inclined to say, with van Inwagen, that's not the tower my son\nbuilt. But when I think about the watch case, I find myself saying that\nis the very same watch. Now, all I can do is invite you to think about\nthese two cases and ask yourself, what should we say here? Of course,\nfor those people who think it really is the same tower, no problem.\nThen we say, the watch and the tower, in both cases, it's the very same\nobject when it's reassembled. Reassemble the body, that'll be the very\nsame body as well. For those people who say, \"Yeah, van Inwagen was\nright about the tower, and the same thing would be true about the\nwatch. The reassembled watch isn't the very same watch,\" then we have\nto say bodily resurrection would not be the very same body. So\nthat wouldn't be me waking up on Judgment Day.\n\nThe alternative is to try to find some relevant difference between\nthe watch case and the tower case. Something that allows us to say that\n\"well, when you reassemble the watch it is the same watch. When you\nreassemble the tower, it's not the same tower. Here's the explanation\nof why those two things work differently in the reassembly cases.\" And\nthen of course, we'd have to further investigate whether when you\nreassemble a body, is it more like the watch case or is it more like\nthe tower case?\n\nI just have to confess, I don't know what the best thing to say\nabout these cases is. I find myself inclined to think reassembled\nwatch, same watch. Reassembled tower, not same tower. Maybe there's a\ndifference there. I don't have a good theory as to what the difference\nis. Since I don't have a good theory as to what the difference is, I'm\nnot in a good position to decide whether a reassembled body would be\nthe same body or a different body. I don't know. So there's\nmetaphysical work to be done here by anybody who's at least interested\nin getting this theory of identity worked out properly.\n\nStill, at least the possibility that we could work this out is still\nthere. So I suppose there's still at least the possibility that bodily\nresurrection would be coherent in such a way that it would still be the\nsame body. So if we accept the body theory, could there be life after\ndeath? Could there be survival of the death of my body? Seems like, as\nfar as I can tell, it's still a possibility, although there's some\npuzzles here that I don't know how to see my way through. Mind you,\nthat's not to say that I myself do believe that there will be a\nJudgment Day, and on that day God will reassemble the bodies. But it at\nleast seems like a coherent possibility.\n\nLet's refine the body view. I've been suggesting that the key here,\nthe idea of whether it's the same person or not, is whether it's the\nsame body. But of course as we know in thinking about familiar objects,\nwe don't need to have every single piece of an object, of an entity,\nstay the same to have the same thing. So I think I previously talked\nabout the steering wheel in my car. Every time I drive the steering\nwheel in my car, I rub off some atoms. But that's okay. It's still the\nvery same physical object. The steering wheel is--Having the same\nsteering wheel is compatible with changing of a few pieces. The same\nthing is true for bodies, right? You get sunburned, your skin peels,\nyou've lost some atoms in your body. It doesn't really matter. It's\nstill the very same body. So if body is the key to personal identity,\nwe don't have to worry about the fact that we're constantly gaining and\nlosing atoms. Yes, question?\n\nStudent: What about someone who loses a huge amount of\nweight?\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Good. The question was, \"What about\nsomebody who loses a huge amount of weight?\" They feel different.\nPeople treat them different. What about that case? Well, I think if\nwe're doing metaphysics, as opposed to psychology--Psychologically, we\nunderstand why losing weight might make a real difference as to how you\nfeel about yourself. And we might even say, loosely, it's as though\nshe's a whole new person. But strictly speaking, we don't think it is\nliterally a whole new person. It's not as though we say, \"Poor Linda\ndied when she entered the spa. Or a week into the spa when she dropped\nthose 50 pounds. Somebody else who remembers all of Linda's childhood,\nsome imitator came along.\" We don't say \"different person.\" We say\n\"same person, lost a lot of weight.\"\n\nNow that's not a problem for the body view, because on the body\nview, the question is, is it the same body? And what we want to say is,\nof course, look, just like it's still your body even if you break your\narm. Even though--It's still your body after you've eaten dinner, and\nso now some molecules have been absorbed into your body that weren't\nthere before. It's still your body after you lose some molecules, even\na lot of molecules. There can be changes in your body that are\ncompatible with it still being the same body. Now, we might worry about\nthe--Which changes? Are all the changes, it's certainly not as though\nany change will do. I mean, suppose what happens is Linda goes to bed\nand what we do in the middle of the night is we take away that body and\nput some new body there. Well that 100% change, that's clearly too\nmuch. Change of some small percentage, from eating, not a problem.\nChange from a somewhat larger percentage of losing a fair bit of weight\ndoesn't seem to be a problem.\n\nSo which changes in bodies make for a different body and which\nchanges in body make for the same body? And in particular, how should\nwe run that if we're thinking about the body as the key to personal\nidentity? I think if we have that question in front of our minds, we're\ngoing to want to say not all parts of the body are equally important.\nYou lose a fair bit of weight, some fat from your gut, not a\nproblem.\n\nHere's one of my favorite examples. In the Star Wars movies, Darth\nVader whips out his light saber and slashes off the hand of Luke\nSkywalker. \"Luke, I am your father.\" \"No!\" Then the hand goes, right?\nThe very next scene--this has always amazed me--the very next scene,\nLuke's got an artificial hand that's been attached to his body and they\nnever even mention it again. No one says, \"Oh, poor Luke. He died when\nDarth Vader cut off the hand.\"\n\nIt seems pretty clear that not all parts of the body matter. You can\nlose a hand and still survive. Same body, except now without a hand.\nSuppose Darth Vader had aimed a little higher and cut off Luke's entire\narm. It would still be Luke. It would still be Luke's body. Suppose,\neven worse, Darth Vader slices off both arms and both legs. It would\nstill be Luke. It would still be Luke's body, though now without arms\nand legs.\n\nWhat part of the body, if any, is essential? Well here's a proposal.\nIt seems to me we'd say something rather different if what happened was\nthat what got destroyed was Luke's brain. Suppose that Darth Vader uses\nthe force--the dark side of the force of course--Darth Vader uses the\ndark side of the force to destroy, to turn into pea soup, Luke\nSkywalker's brain. Now I think we might want to say, \"Well look, no\nmore Luke.\" And if what happens is they drag out some replacement\nbrain, it's still not Luke.\n\nAt least, that's a possible version of the body view. According to\nthis version, which I take to be the most promising, the best version\nof the body view, the crucial question in thinking about personal\nidentity is whether it's the same body--but not all parts of the body\nmatter equally. The most important part of the body is the brain. Well,\nwhy the brain? No surprise there, because of course the brain is the\npart, we now know, the brain is the part of the body that is the house\nof your personality, your beliefs, your desires, your fears, your\nambitions, your goals, your memories. That's all housed in the brain.\nAnd so that's the part of the brain that's the key part of the body for\nthe purpose of personal identity.\n\nThat's what I'm inclined to think is the best version of the body\nview. We find examples of this thought, that the brain is the key, in\nodd places. So let me actually share one with you. This was something\nfrom the Internet that my brother sent to me some years ago. It\npurports to be from a transcript from an actual trial in which a\nlawyer's cross examining the doctor. And you'll see. I don't actually\nknow whether it's true or not, whether it's just somebody made it up.\nBut it purports to be true.\n\nQ: Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you\ncheck for a pulse?\n A: No.\n Q: Did you check for blood pressure?\n A: No.\n Q: Did you check for breathing?\n A: No.\n Q: So then it is possible that the patient was alive when you\nbegan the autopsy?\n A: No.\n Q: How can you be so sure, doctor?\n A: Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar.\n Q: But could the patient have still been alive\nnevertheless?\n A: It is possible that he could have been alive and practicing\nlaw somewhere.\n\n\n\nThe point--The reason that this is funny, other than of course the\nobvious moral, which is that lawyers are morons, is that of course. Why\nis it so clear the lawyer's got to be a moron? Because of course we\nthink, look, lose a hand, the guy could still be alive. Lose an arm,\nlose a leg. Lose the brain, he's not alive. So again this is,\nthis is hardly philosophical proof, but it shows that we're drawn to\nthe thought that the key part of the body is the brain.\n\nNow, think about what the implication of holding that view. Suppose\nwe adopt that version of the body view. If I get a liver transplant, so\nhere I am and we take out my liver and we put Jones' liver inside. I've\ngotten a liver transplant. It's still me. Suppose we rip out my heart\nand put Jones' heart in here. I've gotten a heart transplant. It's\nstill me. Suppose we rip out my lungs and put in Jones' lungs. I've\ngotten a lung transplant. It's still me. Suppose we rip out my brain,\nput in Jones' brain. Have I gotten a brain transplant? No. What's\nhappened is that Jones has gotten a body transplant. Or,\nas we might put it, a torso transplant. If we accept this version of\nthe body theory, we say the crucial part of the body for personal\nidentity is not sameness of torso. The crucial part of the body is\nsameness of brain. Just like \"follow the soul\" was the answer if we\nbelieve in the soul theory of personal identity, if we believe in the\nbrain version of the body theory of personal identity, same person or\nnot? Follow the brain. Same brain, same person. Different brain,\ndifferent person.\n\nAs I've now been saying several times, I think that's the best\nversion of the body view, although not all body theorists believe that.\nAs you know from reading your Perry, the assigned reading, his\nDialogue on Personal Identity and Immortality, the heroine of\nthat story, Gertrude--Gertrude actually thinks the key part of the body\nis the torso. Follow the torso, follow the person. That's what she\nthinks. I'm inclined to say, no. In those moods, when I accept the body\ntheory, I'm inclined to think, no, follow the brain. Gertrude would\npresumably say you get a brain transplant, you got a brain transplant,\nbecause it's the same torso. I want to say, as a fan of the brain\ntheory, you get a brain transplant, what's really happened is somebody\nelse has gotten a torso transplant. Follow the brain.\n\nHow much of the brain? Do we need all of the brain? Well, just like\nwe didn't have to follow the parts of the body that aren't essential\nfor housing the personality, we might ask ourselves, \"Do we need all of\nthe brain to house the personality?\"\n\nResearch suggests that there's a fair bit of redundancy in the\nbrain. You can lose portions of the brain and still have a perfectly\nfunctioning, P-functioning person. Some of you may know that there have\nbeen experiments in which, for one reason or the other, the two halves\nof the brain have been separated. And you often end up there with,\nwell, something closer to two persons being housed within one skull,\nbecause they can often still communicate in various ways. We don't\nquite get that. I gather that the best research suggests we don't\nreally have complete redundancy with hemispheres.\n\nBut suppose that we did. Let's be science-fictiony. Suppose that, as\na kind of backup security, what evolution has done is produced so much\nredundancy in the brain that either half of the brain would suffice.\nAll right, so think about our brain transplant example. So there's an\naccident with Jones and Smith. Jones' torso gets destroyed. His brain\nis fine. Smith's brain has gotten destroyed. His torso is fine. We take\nJones' brain; we put it in Smith's torso. We hook up all the wires, as\nit were. The thing wakes up. Who is that? Jones' brain, Smith's torso.\nFollow the brain. That's Jones that woke up.\n\nVersion two. Horrible accident. Jones' torso has been destroyed and\nthe left half of his brain has been destroyed. But the right half of\nhis brain is still there. Smith's torso is fine, but his entire brain\nhas been destroyed. We take the right half of Jones' brain, put it into\nSmith's torso, hook up all the wires the right way, the thing wakes up.\nWho is it? It's Jones. Follow the brain, and more particularly, follow\nhowever much of the brain it takes to have enough of the brain there to\nstill give you the memories, beliefs, desires, and so forth and so on.\nIf it were true--it probably isn't true, but if it were true--that half\nof the brain was enough, then half the brain would be enough. That\nwould be Jones that woke up. Question?\n\nStudent: [inaudible]\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Great. The question was, \"On this\ntheory, what do we say about the case where we take the two halves of\nJones' brain, split them, put them in two different torsos. They both\nwake up. Would they both be Jones?\" That's a wonderful question. It's a\nwonderful case to think about and, indeed, I am going to come back to\nit. But I just want to bracket it for the time being. But it's a great\nquestion to keep in mind as you think about the plausibility of the\nbody theory.\n\nAll right, so I'm inclined to think that the best version of the\nbody theory has to do with following the brain. So one thing that a\nphysicalist, who does not believe in souls, one thing that a\nphysicalist could say is, \"What's the key to personal identity? The\nbody. Sameness of body.\" And then I'm inclined to think the best\nversion of the body view is the brain view. So that's something that a\nphysicalist can say. And for that matter, it's something that a soul,\nsomebody who believes in souls, could say as well: even though there\nare souls, that may not be the key to personal identity. Maybe sameness\nof body is the key to personal identity.\n\nThat's something a physicalist or dualist can say. But, and\nthis is not--to make good on a promissory note I offered earlier, it's\nnot the only view available to physicalists or, for that matter,\ndualists. Even if there are no souls, we don't have to say that the key\nto personal identity is the sameness of the body. We could instead say\nthe key to personal identity is the sameness of the personality.\n\nAfter all, go back to the Lockean worries about the soul theory of\npersonal identity. It seemed very hard to believe that it isn't the\nsame person when the memories and beliefs and desires and goals and\nambitions and fears are all the same, even if a soul is constantly\nchanging. It seems as though we wanted to say same person. Why? Roughly\nspeaking, because it's the same personality. And with the body view,\nwhen I started arguing a few moments ago that the best version of the\nbody view was the brain view, why did that seem plausible? Why didn't\nwe say that Luke died when he lost his wrist? Because the brain, after\nall, was the part of the body that houses the personality. Enough of\nthe brain was good enough, I said. What counts as good enough? Enough\nto keep the personality.\n\nWell, if what we think is really important here is the personality,\nwhy don't we just say the key to personal identity is the personality?\nLet's just say it's me, provided that there's somebody who's got the\nsame set of beliefs, desires, goals, memories, ambitions, fears. To\ncoin a word, the same \"personality.\" So the secret to personal identity\non this new proposal isn't sameness of body, it's sameness of\npersonality.\n\nNow, it's important to bear in mind that this view is perfectly\ncompatible with being a physicalist. After all, we're not saying that\nin order to have personalities you need to have something nonphysical.\nAs physicalists, we can still say that the basis of personality is that\nthere are bodies that are functioning in certain ways. But for all\nthat, the key to the same person could have to do with the personality\nrather than the sameness of bodies. Of course, normally the way you get\nthe same personality is by having the same body. Still, if we ask,\n\"What's doing the metaphysical work here? What's the key to being the\nsame person?\" we can say sameness of body gave us the same personality,\nbut it was sameness of personality that made it be the very same\nperson.\n\nCould there be some way to get sameness of personality while not\nhaving sameness of body? Maybe. Suppose that we had some disease. The\ndoctor tells me the horrible news that I'm going to have some disease\nthat's going to eventually turn my brain into pea soup. But luckily,\njust before it does it, they can take all of my personality and put it\ninto an artificial replacement brain. So there'll be --just like you\ncan have artificial hearts, artificial livers, you can have artificial\nbrains, which will get imprinted with the same personality. Same\nmemory, same beliefs, same desires, same fears, same goals. We\nobviously can't do that. This is a science fiction story. But at least\nit allows you to see how the body and the personality could come apart.\nAnd so we could have same personality without literally the same brain.\nIf personality is the key to personal identity, that would still be me.\nHold off again for a few minutes, at least, on the question, \"So what\nshould we believe here, the body, the personality view?\" Let's try to\nrefine the personality theory.\n\nSo again, the point I was just emphasizing was even if we accept the\npersonality theory, this doesn't threaten our being physicalists. We\ncan still say the reason that we've got the same personality in the\nnormal case, is there's some physical explanation of what houses the\npersonality. But for all that, the key to personal identity is same\npersonality. Notice, by the way, that somebody who believes in souls\ncould also accept the personality theory of personal identity. Locke\nbelieved in souls. He just didn't think they were the key to personal\nidentity. So you might think, \"Oh no. The physicalist is wrong when the\nphysicalist says that personality--memory, belief, consciousness, what\nhave you--is housed or based in the body. It's based in an immaterial\nsoul.\" Dualists could say that. And yet, for all that, the dualist\ncould consistently say, \"Still, same soul is not the key to personal\nidentity. Same personality is the key to personal identity. If God\nreplaces my soul every 10 minutes, as long as He does it in such a way\nas to imprint the very same personality on the soul, it doesn't matter\nany more than it didn't matter whether or not some of my body parts\nwere changing.\" So the personality theory of personal identity can be\naccepted by physicalists and it can be accepted by dualists.\n\nSo, just to keep score, right now we've got three basic theories of\npersonal identity on the table. The soul theory, the key to personal\nidentity is the same soul. The body theory, the key to personal\nidentity is the same body. Where the best version, I think, is the\nbrain version of the body theory. And the personality theory, the key\nto personal identity is having the very same personality.\n\nWell again, we've got to be careful about refining this. Just like\nwe all agreed, I suppose, that you can have the very same body, even\nthough some of the parts come and go, atoms get added, other atoms get\nknocked off. We can say, we'd better say, that you can have the very\nsame personality even if some of the elements in your personality\nchange.\n\nAfter all, we defined the personality in terms of it being a set of\nbeliefs and memories and desires and goals and fears and so forth. But\nthose things are constantly changing. I have all sorts of memories now\nthat I didn't have when I was 10. I have memories of getting married,\nfor example. I wasn't married when I was 10. So does the personality\ntheorist have to say, \"Uh-oh, different personality. That kid no longer\nexists. That person died, got married and the memories died.\" If we say\nthat, we have very, very short lives. Because after all, right now I've\ngot some memories that I didn't have two hours ago. I have some\nmemories I didn't have 20 minutes ago. If every time you got a new\nmemory you had a new personality and the personality theory said having\nthe very same personality was the key to survival, then none of us\nsurvive more than a few seconds.\n\nWell, the answer presumably is going to be that the best version of\nthe personality theory doesn't require item for item having the very\nsame beliefs, memories, desires, and so forth. But instead requires\nenough gradual overlap.\n\nYour personality can change and evolve over time. So here I am as a\n10 year old child. I've got certain desires, certain memories. As the\nyear goes by, I get some new memories. I lose some of my goals. I no\nlonger--When I was 10, when I grew up I wanted to be a trash collector.\nThat was my first chosen profession. At some point I gave up that\ndesire. I didn't want to be a trash collector anymore. I wanted to be,\nI kid you not, I wanted to be a logician when I was a teenager. I\nwanted to study symbolic logic. So at a certain point I gave that up.\nSo my memories, my desires were changing, but they all changed\ngradually. I lost some old memories. I don't remember everything I knew\nor remembered when I was 10. When I was 10, I had pretty vivid memories\nof kindergarten. Now I have very sketchy memories of kindergarten.\nStill, it wasn't abrupt. It was gradual. There was this slow evolution\nof the personality. And so when the personality theorist says the key\nto personal identity is the same personality, they don't' mean\nliterally the very same set of beliefs and desires. They mean, rather,\nthe same slowly evolving personality.\n\nHere's an analogy. Suppose I had a rope that stretched from that end\nof the room all the way across to this end of the room. Very same rope\nat that end as this end. What makes up a rope? Well as you know, ropes\nare basically bundles of fibers, very thin fibers that have been woven\ntogether in a certain way. But the interesting thing is the fibers\nthemselves aren't actually all that long. They might be a couple of\ninches or at most a foot or so. And so no single fiber stretches all\nthe way across the room. Or even if some fibers did, most of the fibers\ndon't. Does that force us to say, \"Ah, so it's not the very same rope\nat the end as at the beginning\"? No. We don't have to say that at all.\nWhat we want to say is, \"It's the same rope as long as there's this\npattern of overlapping fibers.\" Certain fibers end, but most of the\nfibers are continuing. Some new fibers get introduced. They continue\nfor a while. Eventually maybe those fibers end, but some new fibers\nhave been introduced in the meantime. As long as it's not abrupt.\nImagine I take my scissors and cut out a foot in the middle. Then we'd\nsay there isn't the right kind of pattern of overlap and continuity.\nNow we really do have two ropes--one rope here, one rope there. But if,\nin contrast, there is the right kind of pattern of overlap and\ncontinuity, same rope, even though, even if no single fiber makes it\nall the way across.\n\nSomething analogous needs to be said by the personality theorist.\nEven if I have few or no memories identical to the ones that I had when\nI was 10, that's okay. We can still say it's the same personality, the\nsame evolving personality, so long as there's a pattern of overlap and\ncontinuity. New memories get added, some memories get lost. New goals\nget added, some goals get lost. New beliefs get added, some beliefs get\nlost. There might be few beliefs, desires, goals that made it all the\nway through. But as long as there's the right kind of overlap and\ncontinuity, same personality.\n\nAll right, so what have we got? Three views--soul view, body view,\npersonality view. Three rival theories about the key to personal\nidentity. Now, which of these is right? Well, I don't myself believe in\nsouls, it's hardly going to surprise you to learn that I don't think\nthe soul theory of personal identity is right. For me, the choice boils\ndown to the choice between the body theory of personal identity and the\npersonality theory of personal identity. Of course, in real life, they\ngo hand in hand. In ordinary cases at least, same body, same\npersonality. Both theories are going to say it's the very same person.\nAnd if you believe in souls, you are likely to think, same soul as\nwell. In ordinary cases, you have the same soul, same body, same\npersonality, same person.\n\nTo think about which one of these is the key to personal identity,\nwe need to think about cases, maybe somewhat fantastical,\nscience-fictiony, in which they come apart. Cases in which bodies and\npersonalities go their own ways, as it were.\n\nSo that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to tell you a story in\nwhich your body ends up one place and your personality ends up\nsomeplace else. And I'm going to invite you to think about which of\nthese two resulting end products is me. If you could figure out which\none's you, that would tell you whether you think the body theory is the\nright theory or the personality theory is the right theory.\n\nNow, what's going to be our guide? I'm going to, rather\ngruesomely--not in real life, a science fiction story--I'm going to\ntorture one of the two end products. I'm going to ask you, \"Which one\ndo you want to be tortured?\" Or to put the point more properly, which\none do you want to not be tortured? Because I'm going to assume, I'm\ngoing to take it, that it's important to you that you not be tortured.\nSo by seeing who you want to keep safe, this will help you see which\none you think is you.\n\nOf course, I've got to be sure that you're thinking about this in\nthe right way. Like some of you are probably good, moral individuals\nand you don't want anybody to be tortured. I say, \"Ah, I'm about to\ntorture Linda over there.\" You say, \"No, no. Don't torture Linda.\"\nStill, if I were to say to you, \"I'm about to torture you.\" You'd say,\n\"No, no! Don't torture me!\" and there'd be some extra little something\nwhen you said that, right? So I want to invite you to keep that extra\nlittle something in mind when we tell the stories, which we won't get\nto until next time, when we tell the stories next time, and I say,\n\"Okay, who do you want to be tortured, this person or that person?\" The\nquestion is, from that special egoistic perspective that we're all\nfamiliar with, which is the one you really care about? That's going to\nbe our guide to deciding what's the key to personal identity. But to\nhear the stories, you've got to come back next lecture.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct12.html":{"url":"lct12.html","title":"Lecture 12","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 12 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 22, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: We've distinguished three\ndifferent views as to the secret or key to personal identity across\ntime. There's the soul view, the body view, and the personality view.\nPutting aside, for the most part, the soul view, because I've argued\nthat there are no souls--although occasionally I bring it out just for\nthe sake of comparison and contrast--the main question we want to ask\nourselves is how to choose between the body view and the personality\nview. The body view says follow the body. If somebody around in the\nfuture's got my body, that's me. The personality view says follow the\npersonality, that is, the set of beliefs, desires, memories, goals,\nambitions, and so forth. Somebody around in the future that's got my\nmemories, my beliefs, my desires, that's me. How should we choose\nbetween these two views?\n\nAs I mentioned at the end of last lecture, what I want to do is\noffer us a set of thought experiments. They've got to be thought\nexperiments, because in real life, bodies and personalities go hand in\nhand. But by doing some science fiction experiments, we can take them\napart and ask ourselves, \"Which one do I think is me? When my body goes\none way and my personality goes another way, where do I go?\" Again,\njust to remind you, in order to get the intuitions actually flowing,\nwhat I'm going to do once I've separated the body and the personality\nthis way, is torture one of the end products. So I'm going to be asking\nyou to put yourself in the first person. Imagine this is happening to\nyou. And ask yourself, \"Which one do I want to be tortured? Or which\none do I want to not be tortured?\" Because that will give you some kind\nof evidence as to which one you take to be you.\n\nAnd think about this in that special first person ego-concerned way\nthat comes naturally to us. Just bracket any moral concerns you may\nhave about torturing other people or agreeing that somebody else should\nbe tortured. For our purposes, right now, if I brought up a volunteer\nfrom the class and I'm asking you--here's you, there's the other\nvolunteer--which one do you want to be tortured? it's, \"Let that\none be tortured. Don't let it happen to me.\" That's how we know this is\nme speaking. All right, so that's the question I'm going to ask\nyou. I'll probably slip into talking about this experiment as though\nit's being done to me. But to get it vivid, you should think of it as\nthough it's being done to you. I'll mention, just in passing, that\nthese thought experiments that I'm about to give, I'm going to give a\npair of them, come from Bernard Williams, who's a British\nphilosopher.\n\nAll right, so case number one. Here you are. The mad scientist has\nkidnapped you and he says: I've been working on mind transfer machines.\nAnd what I'm going to do is I've got you and I've also kidnapped\nsomebody else over here, Linda. And I'm going to hook you up to my\nmachines and swap your minds. And what that means is, I'm going to read\noff the memories and the beliefs and the desires from your brain and\nread off the memories and desires and beliefs from Linda's brain. And\nthen I'm going to electronically transfer Linda's memories and beliefs\nand so forth over here and implant them onto this brain. And take your\nmemories and beliefs and so forth and implant them onto Linda's brain.\nFirst, we'll put you to sleep when we do all this procedure. Then when\nyou wake up, you will wake up in Linda's body.\" There'll be something\nhere that, you'll wake up and you'll say, \"What am I doing in this new\nbody? What happened to my beard? How come I'm speaking in this high\nfemale voice?\" Whatever it is, but you'll think to yourself, \"Well,\nhere I am, Shelly Kagan. I seem to be inhabiting Linda's body. Don't\nknow how that happened. Oh yes, the mad scientist kidnapped me and he\ntransferred us, he swapped us. He swapped our bodies, swapped our\nminds. I guess the whole thing works.\"\n\nSo the mad scientist explains all of this to you, but in order to\ngive it a little kicker, because he's also an evil mad scientist--that\nmay be evil already, but because he's an evil mad scientist--he says,\n\"And then when I'm done--\" So over here we've got Shelly's body but\nLinda's personality. So Linda thinking \"What am I doing?\" and \"What am\nI doing in Shelly's body? How did I get a beard?\" So over here, Linda,\nin Shelly's body. Over here, Shelly, in Linda's body. \"I'm going to\ntorture one of these. But because I'm a generous evil mad scientist, I\nwant to ask you which one should I torture?\"\n\nNow, when I think about this, and again, I'm inviting you to think\nabout this in the first person, so this is happening to you. When I\nthink about this, I say \"Torture the one over here.\" I'm going to be\nover here in Linda's body, horrified at what's been going on,\nhorrified that she's being tortured, but at least it's not happening to\nme. That's the intuition I've got when I think about this case.\n\nWhen the mad scientist asks me, \"Which one of these two should I\ntorture?\" I say, \"Torture this one.\" Because if I were to say \"Torture\nthis one\" and then he does it, think about what's going to\nhappen. I'll be thinking \"I'm Shelly Kagan. Oh, this is what a horrible\nsituation. Oh, the pain, the pain! Stop the pain! Make it go away!\" I\ndon't want that to happen to me. If this one's being tortured, nobody's\nthinking to himself, \"Oh, I'm Shelly Kagan in horrible pain.\" So I want\nthis one to be tortured. All right, that's the intuition I've got about\nthe case.\n\nNow, if you've got that same intuition, think about the implications\nof that intuition. You're saying that I, Shelly Kagan, ended up over\nhere. But that's not my body. This is Linda's body. Shelly Kagan's old\nbody is over here. But this is the one that's me, because this is the\none that I don't want to have tortured. So the body isn't the key to\npersonal identity. Personality is the key to personal identity. This\nhas got my personality, my memories of growing up in Chicago, becoming\na philosopher, my thoughts about what I want to have happen to my\nchildren, my fears about how I'm going to explain what's going on to my\nwife. Whatever it is, this is the Shelly Kagan personality over here.\nThis is me. That follows then that this intuition suggests that what I\nfind intuitively plausible is the personality theory of personal\nidentity.\n\nNow, let's tell a different story. Both of these stories, as I say,\ncome from Bernard Williams. Bernard Williams says here's another\nexample we can think about. Mad scientist, again, kidnaps you, kidnaps\nLinda. And he says, \"Shelly, I've got some news for you.\" I'm switching\nbetween you and me. He says, \"Shelly, I've got some news for you. I'm\ngoing to torture you.\" I say, \"No, no! Please don't do it to me!\nPlease, please, don't torture me!\" He says, \"Well, you know, I'm in the\nmad scientist business. This is what I do. I'm going to torture you.\"\nHe says, \"But because I'm a generous mad scientist, before I torture\nyou, what I'm going to do is give you amnesia. I'm going to completely\nscrub clean your brain so that you won't remember that you're Shelly\nKagan. You won't have any memories of growing up in Chicago. You won't\nhave any memories of deciding to become a philosopher. You won't\nremember getting married or having children. You won't remember\nthe--you won't have any desire. The whole thing wiped clean, complete\nperfect amnesia before I torture you. Don't you feel better?\"\n\nNo, I don't feel better. I'm still going to be tortured and now\nwe've added insult to injury. I've got amnesia as well as being\ntortured. No comfort there. \"Well,\" he says, \"Look, I'll make the deal\nsweeter for you. After I give you amnesia, before I torture you, I will\ndrive you insane and make you believe that you're Linda. I've been\nstudying Linda. There she is. I've been reading her psychology by\nlooking at her brain waves and so forth and so on. And so I'm going to\ndelude you into thinking that you're Linda. I'm going to make you think\n‚ÄòOh, I'm Linda.'\" You won't talk like that. \"Oh, I'm Linda.\" \"And\nyou'll have the memories of Linda growing up in Pennsylvania and you'll\nremember Linda's family and, like Linda, you'll want to be an author,\nor whatever it is that Linda wants to be. And then I'll torture you.\nAre you happy now?\"\n\nNo, I'm not happy now. First of all, I'm being tortured. I was given\namnesia. And now you've driven me crazy and make me--deluded me into\nthinking that I'm Linda. No comfort there. He says, \"Okay, last attempt\nto make--you're not being very reasonable,\" he says. \"Last attempt, I'm\ngoing to, after I drive you crazy and make you think you're Linda, I'm\ngoing to do the corresponding thing for Linda. I'm going to give her\namnesia and then I'm going to drive her crazy and make her think that\nshe's Shelly. Give her all of your memories and beliefs and desires.\nNow is it okay that I'm going to torture you?\"\n\nNo. It hardly makes it--it was bad enough I was being tortured and\ngiven amnesia and driven insane. It doesn't really make it any better\nthat you're also going to give amnesia and drive insane somebody else.\nDon't torture me! If you've got to torture somebody, I say in my\nnonethical mood, if you've got to torture somebody, do it to her. Don't\ndo it to me. When I think about this second case, that's my\nintuition.\n\nNow, think about the implications of this second case for the theory\nof personal identity. If I don't want this thing over here to be\ntortured, that must be because I think it's me. But if it's me, what's\nthe key to personal identity? Well, not personality, because after all,\nthis doesn't end up with Shelly Kagan's personality before the torture.\nShelly Kagan's personality is over there. This is Shelly Kagan's body\nand that suggests if I don't want this to be tortured, it's because I\nbelieve in the body theory of personal identity. Follow the body, not\nfollow the personality. Even though he swapped our personalities, it's\nstill me he's torturing. That's the intuition I've got when I think\nabout Bernard Williams' second case.\n\nNow, we're in a bit of a pickle here, from the philosophical point\nof view. Because when we've thought about the first case, the intuition\nseemed to be, ah, personality's the key to personal identity. But when\nwe thought about the second case, the intuition seems to be, huh, body\nis the key to personal identity. That's bad, right? Two different cases\ngive us two different, diametrically opposed, answers on the very same\nquestion. One sec. And it's worse still--Of course, if you don't share\nthe intuitions that I just--I was being honest with you. Those really\nare my intuitions when I think about these cases. If you're with me,\nyou're in a philosophical problem. If you're not with me, if you didn't\nhave the same intuitions, then maybe you don't have a problem. But I've\ngot a problem. And it's worse still because it's not really, if we're\ncareful and think about it, it's not really as though we have two\ndifferent cases and intuitively we want to give different answers to\nthose two different cases.\n\nReally, all we've got there is just one case. It's the very\nsame case, the very same story, that I told two different times. In\nboth cases, before the torturing ends, goes in, there's Shelly Kagan's\nbody over here with Linda's personality and there's Linda's body over\nhere with Shelly Kagan's personality. And we're asking, \"Which one do\nyou want to be tortured?\" It's the very same setup. I just emphasized\ndifferent elements in a way to manipulate your intuitions. But it's the\nvery same case. It can't be that in one of them, follow the body and\nthe other one, follow personality. So it's very hard to know what moral\nshould we draw. The appeal to intuition, thinking about these cases\ndoesn't seem to take us very far. There's a question back there.\nYeah?\n\nStudent: [inaudible]\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Nice suggestion. So the suggestion\nwas this. When the mad scientist put my personality, Shelly Kagan\npersonality, onto Linda's body, he had to modify Linda's brain. And in\nmodifying Linda's brain--this was the question that was just\nraised--hasn't he actually made that brain more like Shelly Kagan's\nbrain than Linda's brain? And if that's right, shouldn't we\nsay--Remember, the best form of the body view, I argued previously, was\nthe brain version. So if this is really Shelly Kagan's brain over here,\nthen this isn't a problem for the body view. We were deceived when we\nsaid the body view said this is Shelly Kagan. Really, the body view, to\nwit, the best version of the body view, that is the brain version, now\nhas to say, \"Oh, we moved Shelly's brain and put it here.\" Well, if\nyou're prepared to say that, then indeed you will be able to say, yeah,\nit's the body view. The body view says, \"Do it to this one.\" Rather,\n\"Don't do it to this one, because this is Shelly Kagan.\"\n\nI don't actually find myself though inclined to agree with you that\nthis has become Shelly Kagan's brain. If you ask me, \"Where's Shelly\nKagan's legs?\" They're still here. \"Where's Shelly Kagan's heart?\" It's\nstill here. \"Where's Shelly Kagan's brain?\" It's still here. It's not\nas though what the scientist did was open up my skull, take the brain\nout. At least, if that's the way we're imagining it, don't imagine\nthat! This is all electronic transfer. It's not as though he took the\nbrain out and literally moved that hunk of tissue over here. All he's\ndone is reprogram Linda's brain.\n\nAnalogy here that might be helpful. Think of the difference between\nthe computer and the programs and files saved on the computer.\nPersonality is a little bit like a program that's running on the\ncomputer. Though we have to have not just the generic program, but the\nspecific data files and databases and so forth. What the mad scientist\ndid, in effect, was wipe out the hard drive, put in the other programs\nfrom the Shelly Kagan computer, but it's still the very same computer.\nIt's still the same central processing unit, or so it seems to me. Of\ncourse, it's true that now, in a certain way, Linda's brain will be\nsimilar to the way that Shelly Kagan's brain had been before. In terms\nof how, as it were, the floppy drives are set up. But still where's,\nliterally speaking, Shelly Kagan's brain? I want to say it's over\nthere, not over here. There was another question or comment. Yeah.\n\nStudent: [inaudible]\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: I'm not quite sure what the question\nis. So the thought is, look, over here we've got Shelly Kagan's body\nwith Linda's personality. If we torture this one, this thing, whoever\nit is, is going to think to itself, \"I'm Linda. I'm in horrible pain. I\nwish it would stop. I wonder whether I'll ever see Linda's husband\nagain.\" Over here we've got Linda's body, Shelly Kagan's personality.\nIf we torture this one--of course to torture, you cause pain to bodies,\nbut the pain gets felt in the mind. So over here, we've got something\nthat's going to think to itself, \"I'm Shelly Kagan. I'm in horrible\npain. I wonder whether I'll ever see Shelly Kagan's wife again.\"\n\nYes, of course, we're torturing bodies. By torturing the bodies we\ncause pain to the minds, the personalities, who have beliefs about\nwho's hurting. What I'm inviting you to think about is which one, if\nyou had to choose between these two gruesome scenarios, which one would\nyou rather save? Which one would you rather protect? Which do you care\nmore about? Making sure that your lump of flesh doesn't have its\nneurons hurt? Or making sure that the person who's thinking to\nyourself, \"I'm Shelly Kagan\" or whatever your name is, that \"I'm in\npain.\" You don't want to be thinking, \"I, Shelly Kagan, am in pain.\" Or\nif your name is Mary, \"I'm Mary. I'm in pain.\" That's what we're trying\nto get straight on here.\n\nThe trouble though is that you tell the very same story two\ndifferent times and I find myself sometimes being pulled this way,\nsometimes being pulled that way. So I can't use thinking about the\nWilliams cases as a method of deciding what do I really believe, the\nbody view or the personality view? I find, myself, you spin the story\none way and I follow the body. You spin the story another way, and I\nfollow the personality. If we're going to have a way to decide between\nthese two theories, it seems as though we need some other kind of\narguments. At least, I need some other kind of arguments, because of\nthe intuitions I've got about the cases.\n\nSo let me turn to a different approach to solving the question,\nanswering the question, which one should we believe? It starts by\nraising a certain philosophical objection to the personality theory.\nIt's going to say, look, the personality theory of personal identity\nhas an implication that we cannot possibly accept. So we have to reject\nthe view. And then become body theorists, if there are no souls.\n\nHere's the objection. It's a common enough objection. It's probably\noccurred to some of you. According to the personality theory, whether\nsomebody is me depends on whether he's got my beliefs. For example, the\nbelief that I'm Shelly Kagan, professor of philosophy at Yale\nUniversity. Well, I'm a not an especially interesting fellow. So let's\nmake it more dramatic and think about Napoleon. You've probably read\nabout this thing. Every now and then there are some crazy people who\nthink they're Napoleon. So imagine that there's right now somebody in\nan insane asylum in Michigan who's got the thought, \"I am Napoleon.\"\nWell, the objection says, clearly this guy's just insane, right? He is\nnot Napoleon. He's David Smith who grew up in Detroit or whatever. He\njust insanely believes he's Napoleon. Yet, the personality theory, the\nobjection says, would tell us that he is Napoleon because he's got the\nbeliefs of Napoleon. He's got Napoleon's personality. Since that's\nobviously the wrong thing to say about the case, we should reject the\npersonality view.\n\nBut not so quick. The personality view doesn't say anybody who has\nany elements at all of my personality is me. One belief in common is\nobviously not enough. Look, we all believe the earth is round. That's\nnot enough to make somebody else me. Of course, the belief, \"I am\nNapoleon\" is a much rarer belief. I presume that none of you have that\nbelief. I certainly don't have that belief. Napoleon had it and David\nSmith in Michigan's got it. But so what? One belief, even one very\nunusual belief's not enough to make somebody Napoleon, according to the\npersonality theory. To be Napoleon, you've got to have the very same\noverall personality, which is a very big, complicated set of beliefs\nand desires and ambitions and memories.\n\nDavid Smith doesn't have that. David Smith in the insane asylum in\nMichigan does not remember conquering Europe. He doesn't remember being\ncrowned emperor. He doesn't remember being defeated by the British. He\ndoesn't have any of those memories. He probably doesn't even speak\nFrench. Napoleon spoke French. He doesn't have Napoleon's personality.\nSo the David Smith case isn't really bothersome. It's not really a\ncounterexample to the personality theory. The personality theory says,\nto be Napoleon, you've got to have Napoleon's personality. But David\nSmith doesn't. So, of course, we can all agree David Smith, despite\nthinking he's Napoleon, is not Napoleon. No problem here for the\npersonality theory.\n\nBut we could tweak the case. We could revise the case. Some foe of\nthe personality theory could say, \"Okay, imagine that this guy in\nMichigan does have Napoleon's personality. He's got the memories\nof being crowned emperor and being defeated, conquering Europe. He's\ngot all of those memories.\" And, remember we want him to have\nNapoleon's personality. He doesn't have any David Smith memories. He\ndoesn't have any memories of growing up in Detroit. How could Napoleon\nhave memories of growing up in Detroit? Napoleon grew up in France. The\nobjection then says even if this guy had all of Napoleon's memories,\nbeliefs, desires, personality, still wouldn't be Napoleon. So the\npersonality theory's got to go.\n\nWell, when I think about this example, I think, now we've got it\nright. That is, that is what the personality theory has to say\nabout that case. But I'm not so confident anymore that it's the wrong\nthing to say. So think of this, as it were, from the point of view of\nNapoleon, right? So there was Napoleon in the 1800s conquering Europe\nand being crowned emperor, being defeated by the British, being sent to\nexile on, was it Elba, right? And I forget where Napoleon actually\ndies, but he's got memories of getting sick and ill and the light\nbegins to fade and he goes unconscious. And then--well, we'll at least\ntry to describe it this way--he wakes up. And he wakes up in Michigan.\nAnd he thinks to himself, \"Hallo. Je suis, Napoleon! [in a French\naccent] What am I doing in Michigan?\" I don't speak French, so I'm\ngoing to drop that, right? \"But the last thing I remember I was going\nto bed from my fatal illness on the Isle of Elba. How did I get over\nhere? I wonder if there's any chance of reassembling my army and\nreconquering the world.\"\n\nIf he had all of that, it's not so clear to me that it would be the\nwrong thing to say that, by golly, this is Napoleon. I mean, it would\nbe totally bizarre. Things like this don't happen. But of course, we're\ndoing science fiction stories here. So we'd say to ourselves, wouldn't\nwe, somehow Napoleon has been reborn or reincarnated, taking over, by\nsome sort of process of possession, the body of the former David Smith,\nbut now it's Napoleon. I find myself thinking maybe that would be the\nright thing to say. Yeah?\n\nStudent: [inaudible]\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: All right, so the thought was, look,\nthis guy over here, David Smith's body with Napoleon's personality--And\nlet's be clear about this. There's no underlying David Smith\npersonality still there, to have the counterexample or the example that\nwe're after. It can't be that he's got mixed together memories of\ngrowing up in France and memories of growing up in Detroit. He never\nthinks to himself, \"I'm David Smith. How did I become Napoleon?\" If you\ngot that junk, you don't have Napoleon's personality. He's just got\nNapoleon's personality through and through.\n\nWell, the question then was, maybe that's not so. After all, he\ndoesn't really have Napoleon's experiences, did he? Napoleon had the\nexperience of being crowned emperor. But this guy didn't have the\nexperience of being crowned emperor. Maybe what we should say is he\nthinks he remembers the experience of being crowned emperor, but\nit's a fake memory. It's an illusion, or a delusion, but he didn't\nreally have the genuine memory. To have the genuine memory, he has to\nhave been crowned emperor. And he wasn't crowned emperor;\nNapoleon was crowned emperor.\n\nWell, that's what we could say, but we can't say that until we\ndecide he's not Napoleon. After all, if the personality theory is\nright, since he does have all of these memories, or semi-memories, or\nquasi-memories, or whatever we should call them. If that's the key,\nthen it is Napoleon. So he is remembering being crowned emperor. If you\nwant to say, no, no, no, those memories are illusions, it must be\nbecause you don't think he's really Napoleon. In which case, what\nyou're discovering is you don't really believe the personality theory.\nWhy isn't he Napoleon? It's not his body. The body of Napoleon is not\nthis body and to be Napoleon, you've got to have Napoleon's body. It's\na possible position. That's the thought that the body theorists are\ntrying to elicit in you when they offer these Napoleonesque\ncounterexamples. You could match the personality as much as you want,\nbut it's still not Napoleon. Don't you agree? That's what they say. And\nif you do agree, that shows you don't really accept the personality\ntheory.\n\nI'm not going to try to settle this here. Who should we believe? The\npersonality theory or the body theory? I'm trying to invite you to\nthink about the implications and the differences between these views so\nas to get clearer in your own mind about which of these you accept. In\nmany moods--at least, when I think about not the simple, the ordinary\nDavid Smith case with a single belief or two, but the full\nbodied--that's a bad term--the full blown Napoleon case with all the\nmemories, all the beliefs. Suppose David Smith there thinks, \"I\nremember. I remember.\" I can't say it in a French accent. \"I remember\nplaying as a lad in France burying my little toy saber.\" Some memory\nthat Napoleon never wrote down in his diaries. And we go and we dig up\nin France and there is the saber, right? This guy remembers things that\nNapoleon would remember. I find myself thinking, well, maybe that's\nNapoleon.\n\nImagine a slightly different version of this case. Napoleon dies on\nhis death bed, wakes up in heaven saying \"Je suis Napoleon. [in French\naccent] I was emperor of Europe and now I have come to my due reward. I\nam here in heaven.\" Well, it seems like what we would want to say is,\n\"Yeah, that's Napoleon.\" It's Napoleon even if it doesn't have\nNapoleon's body. Napoleon's corpse is rotted in France. God gives\nNapoleon some new angelic body. It seems straightforward. If it's got\nNapoleon's memories, beliefs, desires, goals, and so forth and so on,\nwouldn't we say it's Napoleon?\n\nImagine that--back to this earth--this Napoleon type of case\nhappened all the time. We might have a term for this sort of\nthing--possession. Every now and then, people's bodies get possessed.\nThey become this other person who's, now, personality has taken over.\nIf this happened frequently enough, instead of just a little science\nfiction story like with the David Smith case, maybe we'd say, yeah,\npossession is one of these things that needs to be explained. How is it\nthe personality travels? Well, maybe there'll be some sort of physical\nexplanation for it. Still, maybe we'd say, yeah, the people have been\ntaken over. They've become somebody else.\n\nSo speaking personally, I don't find the Napoleon objection a\ntelling one. It doesn't give me a reason to reject the personality\ntheory. But we can now tweak the worry in a slightly different way.\nOkay, so here was Napoleon back in France with his memories and his\nbeliefs and so forth and so on. Death bed, goes to sleep, goes\nunconscious, whatever it is. I told you a story in which he wakes up,\nor his personality wakes up, however we should put it, in Michigan. But\nif it could happen in Michigan, I suppose it could also happen in New\nYork. And if it could happen in New York and it could happen in\nMichigan, I suppose it could happen in New York and Michigan. So right\nnow, let's imagine two people with Napoleon's personalities, complete\npersonalities, one of them in Michigan, one of them in New York. Whoa.\nWhat should we say now? What is the personality theory going to say\nabout this case?\n\nSo I don't know how to draw personalities very well on the board, so\nI'll draw little stick figures of bodies, but I mean these to be the\npersonalities. So here we've got the continuing, evolving over\ntime--this is all taking place in France--the personality of Napoleon\nin France. There's the deathbed scene. Now, up here we had somebody\nwith Napoleon's personality continuing. Of course, he's going to\nchange. He's going to evolve. Just like the actual historical Napoleon\nkept having new beliefs and new desires, if this really was Napoleon in\nMichigan, he'll start having some new desires and beliefs about\nMichigan, which perhaps Napoleon never gave any thought to at all. Who\nknows? So this is Michigan over here. And I said I was willing to\nentertain the possibility that this is all Napoleon. [See Figure\n12.1]\n\nNapoleon, if you think of it, Napoleon's a person extended through\nspace and time. According to the personality view, what makes somebody\nin the future the same person as somebody in the past is if it's part\nof the same ongoing personality. So maybe that's what we've got going\non in the Michigan case.\n\nNow, we imagine in our new version of the worry somebody with\nNapoleon's personality over here in New York. [See Figure 12.2] Now, if\nthe Michigan guy hadn't been there, what I would have done, if I\nbelieved in the personality theory or when I believe in the personality\ntheory, is say \"Oh look, Napoleon--reincarnated in New York.\" That's\nwhat the personality theory should say and I said it doesn't seem like\na crazy thing to say if we only had the guy in New York. Just like it\nwasn't a crazy thing to say if we only had the guy in Michigan.\n\nThe trouble is, imagine the case where we've got one guy who's got\nall of Napoleon's personality in Michigan, one guy who's got all of\nNapoleon's personality in New York. Now what should we say? What are\nthe choices here? Well, I suppose one possibility would be to say the\nguy in New York is Napoleon. The guy in Michigan isn't. He's just an\ninsane guy who's got Napoleon's personality. You could say that. The\nreason that it seems difficult to say though is because it seems like\nit would be just as plausible to say the reverse. Say no, no, no. It's\nnot the New York fellow who's Napoleon. It's the Michigan fellow who's\nNapoleon. Well, we could say that, but the difficulty is there seems to\nbe no good reason to favor the Michigan fellow over the New York\nfellow. Just like there was no good reason to favor the New York fellow\nover the Michigan fellow. Saying that one of them is Napoleon and the\nother one isn't seems very hard to believe.\n\nWell then, what's the alternative? Well, I suppose another\npossibility is to say, at least another possibility worth mentioning,\nis to say they're both Napoleon. [See Figure 12.3] Somehow, bizarrely\nenough, Napoleon split into two. But when splitting into two, he split\non to two bodies, but they are both Napoleon. Now, it's very important\nto understand how bizarre this proposal would be. The claim is not now\nwe've got two Napoleons who are, of course, not identical to each\nother. No, no, we've got a single Napoleon. A Napoleon who was in one\nplace in France and is now simultaneously in two places in the U.S.\n\nThat seems very hard to believe. It seems to just violate one of our\nfundamental notions about how people work, metaphysically speaking.\nPeople can't be in two places at the same time. Well, maybe that\nmetahphysical claim I just made should be abandoned. Maybe we should\nsay, oh, under normal circumstances, people can't be in two places at\nthe same time. But if you had something like this, by golly, this guy\nwould be, Michigan dude is Napoleon and he's the very same person, the\nvery same person as New York dude. New York dude and Michigan\ndude are a single person, Napoleon, who is bilocated. It doesn't\nhappen. But if it did happen, it could happen. Well, maybe that's what\nwe should say. But again, all I can tell you is, I find that too big a\nprice to pay. People can't be in two places. It's one thing to say\npeople are space-time worms extended through space and extended through\ntime. It's another thing to say that they are Y-shaped space-time\nworms. It seems to violate one of the fundamental metaphysical things\nabout how people work.\n\nAll right, I've got to remind you though, none of the options here\nare all that attractive. So when I say, you don't want to say that, you\ndon't want to say that, we're going to run out of possibilities. So\nmaybe this is what you'll want to say.\n\nAll right, saying that Napoleon is in Michigan but not New York\ndoesn't seem very attractive. Saying he's in New York but not Michigan\ndoesn't seem very attractive. Saying he's in both places at the very\nsame time doesn't seem very attractive.\n\nBut what other possibilities are there? If he's not one but not the\nother, and if he's not both, the only other possibility is that he's\nneither. Given this situation, neither of these guys is Napoleon. [See\nFigure 12.4] You've got separate people. There's the person Napoleon, a\nspace-time worm that came to an end in France. And there's some\nspace-time worm taking place in Michigan, some space-time person worm\ntaking place in New York. But neither of them are Napoleon. That seems\nto me to be the least unattractive of the options we've got\navailable.\n\nBut notice that if we say this, if we say neither of these guys,\ndespite having Napoleon's personality, neither of these guys is\nNapoleon, then the personality theory of personal identity is false.\nIt's rejected. We're giving up on it. Because the personality theory,\nafter all, said if you've got Napoleon's personality, you're Napoleon.\nBut now we've got people that are not Napoleon but they've got\nNapoleon's personality. So the personality theory, follow the\npersonality, is wrong if we say neither of these guys is Napoleon. But\nthat does seem to be the least unacceptable of the options. At least\nthat's how it seems to me. So the personality theory's got to be\nrejected.\n\nNow, I think that's right. I think, in fact, the personality\ntheory's got to be rejected. But that doesn't mean we couldn't revise\nit. We could try to change it in a way that keeps much of the spirit of\nthe personality theory, but avoids some of the problems we've just been\nlooking at. Here's what I think is the best revision available to fans\nof the personality theory. They should say we were simplifying unduly.\nWe were simplifying it, getting it wrong, when we said, \"Follow the\npersonality. If you've got Napoleon's personality, that's enough to\nmake you Napoleon.\" That's not true. We need to throw in an extra\nclause to deal with branching, splitting cases, of the sort that I've\njust been talking about. We need to say, if there's somebody in the\nfuture who's got my personality, that person is me, as long as there's\nonly one person around in the future who's got my personality.\nIf you have multiple examples, duplications, splittings and branchings,\nnobody, none of them is me.\n\nSo where the original personality theory said, same personality,\nthat's good enough for being the same person, the new version throws in\na no-competitors clause, throws in a no branching clause. It says, same\npersonality's good enough, as long as there's no branching. If there is\nbranching, neither of the branches is me.\n\nNow, if we say that, if we throw in the no branching clause, then\nwe're able to say, look, in the original story I was telling, where\nthere was the Michigan guy who had Napoleon's personality but no New\nYork guy, that really would be Napoleon, because it would have the same\npersonality with no competitor. Similarly, had we had somebody with\nNapoleon's personality in New York and nobody with the personality in\nMichigan, that guy would have been Napoleon, because we would have had\nthe same personality with no branching, with no competitor. But in the\ncase where we've got branching, where we've got somebody with\nNapoleon's personality both in Michigan and New York, that violates the\nno branching rule, and we just have to say nobody's Napoleon in that\ncase.\n\nAs I say, that seems to me to be the best revision of the\npersonality theory available to them. So what we now need to ask is,\ncan we possibly believe that revision? Can we possibly accept the no\nbranching rule? The no branching rule seems rather bizarre in its own\nright. Think about the ordinary familiar cases that we're trying to\nmake sense of. I'm the same person as the person that was lecturing to\nyou last time. According to the personality theory or the revised\npersonality theory, that's because I've got the same personality. The\nguy last time thought he was Shelly Kagan, believed he was professor of\nphilosophy. I think I'm Shelly Kagan. I believe I'm the professor of\nphilosophy. He's got all sorts of memories of his childhood. I've got\nthe same memories. He's got desires about finishing his book. I've got\nthose desires about finishing my book. Same personality, it's me.\nThat's what the personality theory says. So I conclude, hey, it's me. I\nknow you were all worried whether I'd survive over the break a couple\ndays. Came back, it's still me. I made it through Wednesday.\n\nOr did I? Or perhaps I should ask, \"Or did he?\" Yeah, there was\nsomebody there on Tuesday and yeah, there's somebody here on Thursday,\nand yeah, this person here now has got the same personality as the guy\nwho was there on Tuesday. But according to the no branching rule, we\ncan't yet conclude that I'm the same person as the person that was\nlecturing to you on Tuesday. We can't conclude that until we know that\nthere aren't any competitors, that there isn't anybody else right now\nwho also has the same personality. If I'm the only one around today\nwho's got Shelly Kagan's personality, then I'm the same person as the\nperson who was lecturing to you on Tuesday. But if, unbeknownst to me,\nand I presume unbeknownst to you, there's somebody in Michigan right\nnow who's got Shelly Kagan's personality, then we have to say, huh, it\nturns out I'm not Shelly Kagan after all. Neither is he. Neither of us\nare Shelly Kagan. Shelly Kagan died.\n\nSo am I Shelly Kagan or am I not Shelly Kagan? Can't tell until we\nknow what's going on in Michigan. Whoa! That seems very, very hard to\nbelieve. Whether I am the same person as the person who was lecturing\nto you on Tuesday presumably should turn on facts about that guy who\nwas lecturing to you on Tuesday, and facts about this guy who's\nlecturing to you today on Thursday, and maybe some facts about the\nrelationship between that guy and this guy--or that stage and this\nstage, if we prefer to talk about it that way. We can see how whether\nit's the same person or not has to turn on the relations between the\nstages.\n\nBut how could it possibly turn on what's happening in Michigan? How\ncan whether or not I am the same guy as the guy who was lecturing to\nyou on Tuesday depend on what's happening in Pennsylvania or Australia\nor Mars? To use some philosophical jargon, the nature of identity seems\nlike it should depend only on intrinsic facts about me or perhaps\nrelational facts about the relations between my stages. But it\nshouldn't depend on extrinsic, external facts about what's happening\nsomeplace else. But if we accept the no branching rule, we're saying\nwhether or not we've got identity depends on what's happening\nelsewhere. With the no branching rule, identity ceases to be a strictly\ninternal affair. It becomes, in part, an external affair. That's very,\nvery hard to believe. And if you're not prepared to believe it, it\nlooks as though you've got to give up on the personality view.\n\nLast thought. During all of these problems for the personality\ntheorist, the body theorist, the fans of the body theorist, is standing\nthere laughing. \"Ha! You poor fools. Look at all the problems you've\ngot adopting the personality theory. See how easy it is to duplicate\npersonalities, leading to these totally implausible no branching rules.\nWe can avoid all of that if we become body theorists.\" What we'll ask\nourselves next time is whether or not the body theorist is in a better\nsituation.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct13.html":{"url":"lct13.html","title":"Lecture 13","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 13 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 27, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Let me start by reviewing the problem\nthat we were considering last week. We were raising a difficulty for\nthe personality theory of personal identity according to which the key\nto being the same person is having the very same ongoing, evolving\npersonality. And the difficulty was basically the problem of\nduplication. That it seemed as though we could have more than one--call\nit an individual--more than one body, that had the very same set of\nmemories, beliefs and so forth. And that we have to ask ourselves,\n\"Well, what should the personality theory say about a case like\nthat?\"\n\nSo imagine that over the weekend, the mad scientist copied my\nmemories, beliefs, desires, fears, ambitions, goals, intentions and\nimprinted that on somebody else's brain. They did it last night at\nmidnight. This morning, we woke up. And we have to ask ourselves,\n\"Who's Shelly Kagan? Who's the person that was lecturing to you last\nweek?\" Well, it doesn't seem plausible in terms of the personality\ntheory to say that he's Shelly Kagan, and the one here\ntoday--Suppose the other one's in Michigan. If the one in Michigan's\nShelly Kagan but this one's not--After all, although it's true that\nhe's got Shelly Kagan's memories, he woke up thinking he was Shelly\nKagan, just like I woke up thinking I was Shelly Kagan. He woke up\nthinking about what he was going to lecture on in class today, just\nlike I woke up thinking about what I was going to lecture in class\ntoday. He remembered last week's lecture just like I remembered last\nweek's lecture.\n\nWell, no clear reason to say--for the personality theory to\nsay--that he's Shelly Kagan and I'm not. After all, I've got the very\nsame set of memories, beliefs, desires that he has. But equally true,\nand more surprisingly, from the personality theory point of view,\nthere's no reason to say that I'm Shelly Kagan and he's\nnot. After all, he's got all the same memories, beliefs and desires\nthat I do. It doesn't seem plausible to say we're both Shelly\nKagan, because now we'd have to then say Shelly Kagan's in two places\nat the same time. So the only alternative seems to be to say that\nneither of us is Shelly Kagan. But if neither of us is Shelly Kagan,\nthen the simple original personality theory was false. Because\naccording to that theory, having the personality is what it took to be\nShelly Kagan. We both have it, yet neither of us is Shelly Kagan. The\npersonality theory must be false.\n\nSo we revise the personality theory to say, the secret to personal\nidentity is having the same personality--provided that there's no\nbranching. Provided there's no splitting. Provided there's only one\nbest competitor, not two equally good candidates. Given the no\nbranching view, the no branching rule, we can say, in the ordinary\ncase, look, there really wasn't anybody imprinted with my memories and\ndesires in Michigan. I'm the only one around in the earth right now\nwith Shelly Kagan's memories and desires. Since there's no competitor,\nand I've got the personality, I'm Shelly Kagan. I'm the very same\nperson that was here lecturing to you last week. That's what the\npersonality theory--It gives us the answer we're looking for in the\nordinary case. But in the science fiction story where there's a\nduplicate, it says, uh, if there's branching, the no branching rule\ncomes in. Neither of them is Shelly Kagan.\n\nAll right, so that's the best way for the personality theory to get\nrevised to deal with this problem. The trouble was, it seems the no\nbranching rule seems very counter-intuitive. So think about it. Here,\nright now I'm standing in front of you saying I'm Shelly Kagan, the guy\nwho was lecturing to you last week. I believe I'm Shelly Kagan, the guy\nwho was lecturing to you last week. Am I Shelly Kagan? Well, I've got\nShelly Kagan's personality. So far so good. Now all we have to decide\nis, was the branching rule satisfied or violated? So all we have to\nknow is, is there somebody else somewhere in the universe who's got all\nmy memories and beliefs and desires? Well, how in the world could I\nknow that?\n\nWhether I, this person talking to you right now, is Shelly Kagan\ndepends on whether there's some duplicate with all my memories in\nMichigan or not? It seems very counter-intuitive. So although the\npersonality with no branching rule avoids the problem of what to say\nabout duplicates, by saying when there's branching, neither of them is\nShelly Kagan, the branching rule itself seems very counter-intuitive.\nWe feel as though whether somebody is me or not should depend upon\ninternal facts about me in the earlier stages or this stage and that\nstage, not about what's happening elsewhere, outside, extrinsic to\nthese things. So, if you're not willing to accept the no branching\nrule, if it strikes you as a bizarre thing to throw in to personal\nidentity, maybe you need to reject the personality theory.\n\nNow during all of this, the fans of the body view typically are\nlaughing. They say this just goes to show what a dumb theory the\npersonality theory is. The whole problem with the personality theory is\nthat personality is a bit like a software. It's like programs. It's the\nvarious programs you run on your computer along with the various data\nfiles that you have saved on your hard drive, and so forth. And those\ncan be duplicated. You have copy after copy after copy. You can have\ntwo copies of my personality. You could have 100 or 1,000. The problem\nwith--what drove the personality theory into the no branching rule,\nimplausible as it may be, was the fact that your personality is like\nsoftware, and it can be copied.\n\nThat's why, they say, we should believe in the body view. If we\naccept the body view, we avoid the duplication problem. Because, unlike\nsoftware, which can be literally copied, as many as you want identical,\nthe body can't split. Human bodies can't divide or branch. There's no\nway that there's another body, that the body on Thursday became two\nbodies. The body that was here on Thursday didn't, couldn't become two\nbodies. So we avoid all the problem. That's at least the kind of claim\nthat fans of the body view often make in the face of this difficulty\nfor the personality theory.\n\nWell, now we need to ask, is it really true? Is it really true that\nbodies don't face a duplication problem? Is it really true that human\nbodies don't and couldn't split? Look, the crucial word here is, of\ncourse, \"couldn't.\" Personalities don't actually split either, right?\nAlthough I've been giving science fiction examples in which the mad\nscientist duplicates my memories and beliefs and desires, they've all\nbeen science fiction examples. If I can use science fiction to talk\nabout the possibility of splitting, and use that against the\npersonality theory, I'm entitled to use science fiction examples to\ntalk about the possibility of bodies splitting, and ask, what kind of\nproblem that would raise for the body theory?\n\nNow, we are familiar with some low-level examples of bodies\nsplitting. Amoebas split, right? You've got a single amoeba. It's going\nalong. At a certain point--Let's draw our amoeba splitting, right? [See\nFigure 13.1] You've got an amoeba split, going along. At a certain\npoint, it starts to look like that. Then it looks like that. And then\nboom! You've got, well, it splits. There's nothing in biology per se\nthat rules out cell division. Indeed, on the contrary, right? We know\ncells can split. Now, human bodies, unlike amoebas, don't do that. But\nmaybe there's nothing in biology that rules out the possibility.\nSuppose we open up the Yale Daily tomorrow and we see that the\nYale Center for Amoebic Studies has made this tremendous breakthrough\nand has discovered how to, through the right kind of injection or\nwhatever, cause a human body to replicate and split in an amoeba-like\nfashion. Well, then we have to face the problem of what to say in this\ncase of bodily branching.\n\nWell, instead of pursuing that example, let me give you a slightly\ndifferent example that's been discussed a fair bit in the philosophical\nliterature. This is actually a case that one of the students in the\nclass asked about, I think it was last week, if it wasn't even earlier.\nAnd I said, \"Great question. Let's come back to it.\" So here, at long\nlast, I'm making good on my promissory note. I'm going to come back to\nthe example that was raised before.\n\nYou'll recall that when we talked about the body view, I said the\nbest version of the body view doesn't require the entire body, to be\nthe same body, but the brain. Follow the brain. And indeed, it doesn't\nseem as though we have to require the entire brain, just enough of the\nbrain, however much that turns out, to house personality, memories and\nso forth. And then, I said, suppose it was possible that one hemisphere\nof your brain is enough. If there's enough redundancy in the brain so\nthat even if your right hemisphere got destroyed, your left hemisphere,\nyou still have all the same memories, desires, beliefs. Good\nenough.\n\nSo now we worry about the following case. So I gave you a bunch of\nexamples, right, where there are brains being transplanted into torsos\nof others. So suppose, gruesome as it was, this weekend I'm in some\nhorrible accident and my torso gets destroyed and they keep my brain on\nlife support, oxygenating it just long enough to do some radical\nsurgery into some spare torsos. Where'd the torsos come from? Well, you\nhad some living people, but they had very rare brain diseases and their\nbrain suddenly liquefied. So now we've got some spare torsos.\n\nAll right, so here we've got Shelly Kagan. His body gets destroyed.\nAnd here's my brain. Over here we've got Jones' torso. And over here\nwe've got Smith's torso. Suppose we take, call this one the left\nhemisphere, and we stick it in here, into Jones' torso. We take this\nother hemisphere, the right half of my brain and we stick it into\nSmith's torso. We connect all the wires, all the neurons. The\noperation's a smashing success. Both things wake up. So here's Jones'\ntorso with the left half of SK's brain. Smith's torso with the right\nhalf of SK's brain. They wake up. We need some way to refer to these\npeople, so we can start talking about who they are. Let me just call\nthis top one--Jones' torso with the left half of Shelly Kagan's\nbrain--let's call him Lefty. Smith's torso with the right half of\nShelly Kagan's brain, let's call him Righty. [See Figure 13.2]\n\nOkay, operation's a success. Lefty and Righty both wake up. They\nboth think they're Shelly Kagan, and so forth and so on. And we ask\nourselves, according to the body view, which one is Shelly Kagan?\n\nWhat are the possibilities? We could say Lefty is Shelly Kagan and\nRighty is not. Righty's an imposter. But there's nothing in the body\nview to give us a reason to make that choice. It's true that Lefty's\ngot half of Shelly Kagan's brain and that's good enough. But it's also\ntrue that Righty's got half of Shelly Kagan's brain and that seems good\nenough. So there's no reason to say that Lefty is Shelly Kagan and\nRighty isn't. And similarly, of course, there's nothing in the body\nview to make us say that Righty is Shelly Kagan and Lefty isn't.\n\nWell, if it's not one, and not the other, what are the remaining\npossibilities? We could, I suppose, try to say they're both\nShelly Kagan. And so Shelly Kagan continues, that is to say his body\ncontinues, that is to say his brain continues, that is to say enough of\nhis brain continues, merrily on its way, except now in two places. And\nso from now on, Shelly Kagan, that single person, is in two different\nplaces at the same time. Lefty goes to California. Righty moves to\nVermont. From now on, Shelly Kagan's bicoastal. It doesn't seem\nright.\n\nSo what else can the body theory say? Well, the body theory could\nsay neither of them are Shelly Kagan. Shelly Kagan died in that\ngruesome, horrible accident. Although it's true that we now have two\npeople, Lefty and Righty, each of whom has half of Shelly Kagan's\nbrain, and all of Shelly Kagan's memories, for whatever that's worth,\nneither of them is Shelly Kagan. We could say that as well. But if\nwe--and that seems the least unpalatable of the alternatives. But if we\nsay that, then we've given up on the body view. Because the body view,\nafter all, said to be Shelly Kagan is to have enough of Shelly Kagan's\nbrain. And in this case, both of Lefty and Righty seem to have enough\nof Shelly Kagan's brain. What's the body theorist to do?\n\nAs far as I can see, the best option for the body theorist at this\npoint is to add--no surprises here--a no branching rule. The body\ntheorist should say, \"The key to personal identity is having the same\nbody, to wit, the same brain, to wit, enough of the brain to keep the\npersonality going--provided that there's no branching, no splitting, no\nperfect competitors, only one.\" If the body view adds the no branching\nprinciple, then we can say, look, in the case of this sort of\nsplitting--This example is known in theto philosophical literature as\nfission, like nuclear fission when a big atom splits into two. So, in\nthe fission case, the body says, the body theorist says, in the fission\ncase, there's splitting, there's branching. So neither of them is going\nto end up being Shelly Kagan.\n\nBut in the ordinary humdrum case, here I am, my body. Why am I\nShelly Kagan? Because the brain in front of you--you can't see it, but\nit's in front of you--the brain in front of you is the very same brain\nas the brain that you had in front of you on Thursday. Follow the body,\nin particular follow the brain. So in the ordinary case, no splitting,\nfollow the brain. In the special case where there's splitting, even if\nyou follow the brain, not good enough. So the body theorist can avoid\nthe problem of fission, avoid the problem of duplication by adding the\nno branching rule.\n\nBut of course, the no branching rule didn't seem very intuitive.\nWhether or not I'm Shelly Kagan, the guy that was lecturing to you on\nThursday, depends on whether, unbeknownst to me, over the weekend,\nsomebody removed half of my brain, stuck it in some other torso, sealed\nme all back up. How could that matter?\n\nWell, if you don't find the no branching rule plausible, you're in\ntrouble as a body theorist. In fact, so what we see is, the body theory\nis in exactly the same problem, exactly the same situation, as the\npersonality theory. Indeed, the fission example is a very nice case of\nhow you could have splitting for the personality theory. Here, before\nthe accident, was Shelly Kagan, somebody who had my beliefs, desires,\nmemories, goals, and so forth. After the accident, we've got two\npeople, Lefty and Righty, or two entities, Lefty and Righty, both of\nwhom have Shelly Kagan's memories, beliefs, desires, goals, and so\nforth. Splitting the brain shows how you could, in fact, have splitting\nof personality. So the very same case raises the very same problem for\nboth the body view and the personality view. And the only solution that\nI can see, at least the best solution that I can see, is to accept the\nno branching rule. If you don't like the no branching rule, it's not\nclear what your alternatives are. Or at least, it is clear what your\nalternatives are; it's not clear which alternative would be any\nbetter.\n\nNow during all of this--problems for the personality theory,\nproblems for the body view--during all of this, the soul theorist is\nhaving a field day. The soul theorist is saying, \"Look you guys, you\ngot into all this trouble with splitting and so forth and so on, and\nneeding to add the no branching rule, silly and implausible as that\nseems, you got into all that trouble because of the problem of\nsplitting because personalities can be split, bodies can be split. If\nonly you had seen the light and stuck to the soul theory of personal\nidentity, all these problems could be avoided.\" Now, as you know, I\ndon't believe in souls. But forget that issue for the moment. Let's\njust ask the question, \"Is it true that the soul theory--if only there\nwere souls--is it true that the soul theory would at least have the\nfollowing advantage? It avoids these problems of duplication and\nfission.\"\n\nWell let's ask. What should a soul theorist say about the fission\ncase? So here's the gruesome accident. My brain gets split apart. One\npart gets put into Jones' torso. One part gets put into Smith's torso.\nAfter the operation, Lefty wakes up thinking he's Shelly Kagan. Smith\nwakes up thinking he's Shelly Kagan. Lefty's got part of Shelly Kagan's\nbrain. Smith's, or rather Righty's got part of Shelly Kagan's brain.\nWhat should the soul theorist say about the case of fission? Well,\nagain, remember, the soul theory says the key to being the same person\nis having the soul. Why am I the person that was lecturing to you on\nThursday? Because it's the very same soul animating my body, or what\nhave you.\n\nSo, what does the soul theorist say about the fission case? I'm not\nquite sure, because we have to turn to a metaphysical question that\nwe've touched upon before, namely, can souls split? After all, the\nproblem that fission raises for the personality theory, in a nutshell,\nis that personalities can split, they can branch. The problem for the\nbody view that fission raises, in a nutshell, is that bodies can split.\nThey can branch. We need to ask about the metaphysics of the soul, can\nsouls split? And I don't know the answer to that, of course. So let's\nconsider both possibilities.\n\nPossibility number one. Souls, just like bodies, just like\npersonalities, can split. Suppose that's what happened. So, there was a\nsingle soul here, Shelly Kagan's soul, but in the middle of this\ngruesome operation, gruesome accident and followed by this amazing\noperation, Shelly Kagan's soul split. So there's one of the SK souls\nover here and there's one of the SK souls in the other case as well.\nEach one of Lefty and Righty has one of the pieces of the split Shelly\nKagan soul.\n\nAll right, so now we ask ourselves, \"According to the soul theory,\nwhich one is Shelly Kagan?\" Well, you--By this point, you can run\nthrough all the possibilities yourself, right? We could say, well, it's\nLefty and not Righty. But there's nothing in the soul theory that\nsupports that claim. They each have an equally good--however good it\nmay be--they've got an equally good piece of the original Shelly Kagan\nsoul. So there's no reason to say that Lefty is Shelly Kagan and Righty\nisn't. There's no good reason to say Righty is Shelly Kagan and Lefty\nisn't.\n\nWell, would it be better to say they're both Shelly Kagan, as\nlong as you've got a piece of Shelly Kagan's soul, of the original\nsoul, then you just are Shelly Kagan? In which case, Lefty and Righty\nare both Shelly Kagan, and Shelly Kagan is now bicoastal, one in\nCalifornia, one in Vermont, one part of him? That doesn't seem very\nsatisfying.\n\nWhat's the alternative? The alternative, it seems, for the soul\ntheorist, is to say, neither of them is Shelly Kagan. Neither of\nthem is Shelly Kagan, then Shelly Kagan died. But how can we say that\nif we accept the soul theory? They both have pieces of Shelly Kagan's\nsoul. The soul split. Well, maybe what the soul theorist would have to\ndo at this point is accept the--da-ta-da--the no branching rule. \"Ah,\"\nsays the soul theorist, \"Follow the soul--unless the soul splits, in\nwhich case neither of them is Shelly Kagan.\" Well, the trouble is, we\ndidn't find the no branching rule very plausible. It seemed\ncounterintuitive.\n\nBut at this point, you begin to wonder, maybe we just need to learn\nto live with it. If the personality theory needs the no branching rule,\nand the body theory needs the no branching rule, and the soul theory\nneeds the no branching rule, maybe we're just stuck with the no\nbranching rule, whether or not we like it. And if we're stuck with it,\nthen of course it's not an objection against any one of the theories\nthat uses it. Well, this is all what we would say as soul theorists if\nwe think souls can split.\n\nBut we need to consider the possibility that souls can't split.\nMaybe the soul theorist has an alternative available to it\nthat--available to him that the other theories don't have. Suppose\nShelly Kagan's soul cannot split. What does that mean? It means, when\nmy brain gets split, my soul is going to end up in Lefty or in Righty,\nbut not in both. If a soul can't split, you can't end up with pieces of\nthe soul or the remnants of the soul in both. The soul is a unified\nsimple thing.\n\nNow, I don't actually know whether it's true that simple things\ncan't split. Metaphysically, I'm not sure whether that's a possibility\nor not. But let's just suppose--look, Plato argued the soul was simple.\nHe didn't actually convince me of that, but suppose we thought souls\nare simple, and we think simple things can't split. It would follow,\nthen, that souls can't split.\n\nSuppose we accept all that metaphysics. Then the question is just,\nwhich one is Shelly Kagan? Well, it depends which one ended up with\nShelly Kagan's soul. We can't say, they both have a piece. One of them\nwill have it, the other one won't. And you want to know which one's\nShelly Kagan? The one that actually ends up with Shelly Kagan's soul.\nIf Lefty ends up with Shelly Kagan's soul, then Lefty is Shelly Kagan\nand Righty is an imposter. He thinks he's Shelly Kagan, but he's not,\nbecause he doesn't have Shelly Kagan's soul. Lefty has it. If Righty's\ngot Shelly Kagan's soul, then Righty is Shelly Kagan and Lefty is the\nimposter.\n\nNow, looking at the situation from the outside, we might be unable\nto tell which one is really Shelly Kagan. Because we won't be able to\ntell, looking at it from the outside, which one really has Shelly\nKagan's soul. Although it will be true, whichever one really does have\nShelly Kagan's soul is Shelly Kagan. But we don't know which one that\nis.\n\nInterestingly, and somewhat more surprisingly, looking at it from\nthe inside, we won't be able to tell either. Lefty will say, \"Give me a\nbreak. Of course I'm Shelly Kagan. Of course I've got Shelly Kagan's\nsoul. Of course I'm the one.\" But Righty will also say, \"Give me a\nbreak. Of course I'm Shelly Kagan. Of course I've got Shelly Kagan's\nsoul. Of course I'm the one.\" If souls can't split, one of them is\nmistaken. But there's no way for them to know which one is the one\nthat's deceived.\n\nNow, that may not be a problem that you're unwilling to swallow. As\nwe've seen, all the views here have their difficulties. Maybe that's\nthe difficulty you're prepared to accept. What's the right answer in\nfission? It depends on who's got Shelly Kagan's soul. No way to tell.\nBut still, that's the answer to the metaphysical question.\nQuestion?\n\nStudent: What happens if neither of these had Shelly Kagan's\nsoul?\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: The question was, \"What if neither of\nthese have Shelly Kagan's soul?\" Then they're both imposters. That's a\nlittle bit like the case we worried about when we started thinking\nabout the soul view, right? What if last night God destroyed my soul\nand put in a new soul? Then Shelly Kagan died. If Shelly Kagan's soul\ndoes not migrate to Lefty or Righty, neither of them is Shelly Kagan,\naccording to the soul theory. What happened to Shelly Kagan? Well, if\nthe soul got destroyed, Shelly Kagan died. If the soul didn't get\ndestroyed, maybe somebody else that we weren't even looking at is\nShelly Kagan.\n\nSo as I say, the soul theory can at least give us an answer that\navoids the no branching rule. If souls are simples and simples can't\nsplit, there's no possibility of having two things with a relevant\nsoul. So we don't need to add, in this ad hoc fashion, the no\nbranching rule. That's an advantage for the soul theory, if only we\nbelieved in souls. It is an advantage. But I need to point out that\nthere's another disadvantage that the fission case raises for the soul\ntheory.\n\nSo let's just suppose that metaphysically God tells us that it's\nLefty that has Shelly Kagan's soul. Then of course it's Lefty that is\nShelly Kagan. Righty is an imposter. Righty believes he's Shelly Kagan,\nhe has all the memories of Shelly Kagan, all the desires of Shelly\nKagan, but he's not Shelly Kagan because he doesn't have Shelly Kagan's\nsoul. Lefty happens to have it. That's a nice answer to the problem of\nfission, but notice the problem it raises for the argument for\nbelieving in a soul in the first place.\n\nWay back at the start of the semester when we asked, \"Why believe in\nsouls?\" one important argument was, or really family of arguments was,\nyou need to believe in souls in order to explain why bodies are\nanimated, why people are rational, how they can have personalities, how\nthey can be creative, and so forth. In order to explain consciousness\nand self-awareness. Whatever it was, fill in your favorite blank, fill\nin the blank in your favorite way. The claim was, you needed to believe\nin souls in order to explain all that.\n\nBut if that's right, what's going on in Righty's case? Righty is\naware. Righty is conscious. Righty is creative. Righty has free will.\nRighty makes plans. Righty's got personality. Righty is rational.\nRighty's body is animated. According to the soul-theory argument for\nsoul, rather, according to the argument for souls, you needed to\nbelieve in souls in order to explain how you could have a person. But\nnow Righty's a person without a soul, because we just hypothesized, oh,\nShelly Kagan's soul's up there. So at the very same moment that\npositing the nonsplitting of souls seems to solve the fission problem\nof duplication, it yanks the rug out from underneath the soul theorist\nby undermining one of the types of arguments for believing in the soul\nin the first place. After all, if Righty can be a person, admittedly\nnot Shelly Kagan, but a person--conscious, creative, rational, so\nforth, aware--without a soul, then maybe the same thing is true for us,\nwhich is of course what the physicalist says.\n\nLet me mention one other possibility, because it's quite intriguing.\nSuppose the soul theorist answers that last objection by saying, \"Ain't\never going to happen.\" Yeah, it would be a problem for believing in\nsouls if Righty could wake up without one. But since we stipulated that\nShelly Kagan's soul is going to end up in Lefty, Righty is not going to\nwake up. Alternatively, it might have been that Righty woke up, but\nLefty doesn't wake up, doesn't survive the operation. Suppose we did\nthese sort of brain transfers all the time and the following thing\nalways happened. Transfer the entire brain, the patient wakes up.\nTransfer one hemisphere, the patient wakes up. Transfer both\nhemispheres, one patient or the other wakes up, but never both. If that\nhappened, we'd have a great new argument for the existence of a soul.\nWhat could possibly explain why either hemisphere of the brain would\nnormally be enough, as long as we don't transfer both? When we transfer\nboth, one hemisphere might work sometimes, sometimes the other\nhemisphere, but never both. What could possibly explain that? Souls\ncould explain that. If souls can't split, it can only follow one half\nof the brain, and that's why we'll get somebody that's got one half,\nsometimes the other half, but never both halves.\n\nSo there's a kind of empirical argument for the existence of the\nsoul if we found those kinds of results. Of course, that's a big \"if.\"\nPlease don't go away thinking that what I just said is, here's a new\nargument for the soul. We don't do brain transfers, let alone have a\nhalf-a-brain transfers. We don't have any experiments that suggest one\nhalf wakes up, but not the other half. All I'm saying is that if\nsomeday we found that, at that point, we'd have an argument for the\nsoul.\n\nWell again, let me put away the soul theory again. I was exploring\nit because it's interesting to think about its implication. But since I\ndon't believe in souls, I want to choose between the body view and the\npersonality view. Both of them, as we saw in the face of fission, needs\nto accept a no branching rule. If they're going to survive thinking\nabout this case at all, we need to throw in a no branching rule.\nWhether or not you find the no branching rule hard to believe, if both\nviews are stuck with it, well, then we're stuck with it. So let's try\nto choose between the personality theory with the no branching rule and\nthe body theory with the no branching rule. Which of these should we\naccept? Which of these is the better theory of personal identity?\nAnswer, \"I'm not sure.\"\n\nOver the course of my philosophical career, I have moved back and\nforth between them. There was certainly a long period of time in which\nI found the personality theory, that is, the personality theory with a\nno branching rule, to be the better and more plausible theory. And it\ncertainly has any number of advocates on the contemporary philosophical\nscene. But at other times in my philosophical career, I have found the\nbody theory, that is to say, the body theory with the no branching\nrule, to be the more plausible theory. And it is certainly the case\nthat the body theory has its advocates among contemporary\nphilosophers.\n\nFor what it's worth--and I don't actually think that what I'm about\nto say is worth all that much--I'm going to share with you my own pet\nbelief. These days I'm inclined to go with the body theory. I'm\ninclined to think that the key to personal identity is having the same\nbody, as long as there's no branching, as long as there's no splitting.\nBut it's certainly open to you to decide that you think no, no, the\npersonality theory is the stronger view. I can't settle the question. I\ndon't have any more philosophical arguments up my sleeve on this issue.\nBut I do have another point that's worth considering. Although I'm\ninclined to think that the body theory may be the best view about\nwhat's the key to personal identity, I'm also inclined to think it\ndoesn't really matter.\n\nWe've been posing the following question. We've been asking, \"What\ndoes it take for it to be true that I survive?\" And it may be that what\nwe should conclude is, whatever the best answer to that question is,\nit's not the question we should really have been thinking about. We\nweren't going to be in a position to see that until we went through all\nthe stuff we've been going over for the last couple of weeks. But now\nthat we're here, we're in a position perhaps to raise the question,\nshould we be asking what it takes to survive? Or should we be\nasking about what matters in survival?\n\nNow, in posing this question, I'm obviously presupposing that we can\ndraw a distinction between the question, \"Do I survive? Is somebody\nthat exists in the future, whatever, me?\" and the question, \"What was\nit that I wanted, when I wanted to survive? What was it that\nmattered in ordinary survival?\" And it might be that these things can\nactually come apart. To see this, suppose we start by thinking again\nabout the soul view. Suppose there are souls. I don't believe in them,\nbut let's imagine. Suppose there are souls. And suppose that souls are\nthe key to personal identity. So somebody is me if they've got my soul.\nOr, to put it more straightforwardly, next week the person that's me is\nthe person with my soul. I survive as long as there's somebody around\nwith my soul. A hundred years from now, am I still around? Well, if my\nsoul's still around, that's me. That's what the soul theory says. And\nsuppose it's the truth.\n\nNow, consider the following possibility. Suppose that people can be\nreincarnated. That is to say, at the death of their body, their soul\ntakes over, animates, inhabits, gets connected to a new body that's\nbeing born. But, unlike the kind of reincarnation cases that get talked\nabout in popular culture and various religions where, at least under\nthe right circumstances, you can remember your prior lives, let's\nimagine that when the soul is reincarnated, it's scrubbed completely\nclean, no traces whatsoever of the earlier life. No way to retrieve it.\nNo karmic similarities of personality or anything, just starts over\nlike a blank slate. Like a blackboard that's been completely erased, we\nnow have the very same blackboard, and now we start writing new things\non it. Imagine that that's the way reincarnation worked.\n\nSo somebody asks you, \"Will you still be around in 1,000 years?\" The\nanswer's going to be, yes, because my soul will be reincarnated. In\n1,000 years there'll be somebody that has the very same soul that's\nanimating my body right now. Of course, that soul won't remember being\nShelly Kagan. It won't have any memories of its prior life. It won't be\nlike Shelly Kagan in any way in terms of Shelly Kagan's desires or\nambitions or goals or fears. It won't be that--We can see why that\npersonality emerges through karmic cause and effect in any way that are\na function of what I was like in my life. It'll be Shelly Kagan,\nbecause it's Shelly Kagan's soul, but with no overlap of personality,\nmemories, anything.\n\nThen I want to say, who cares? The fact that I will survive under\nthose circumstances doesn't give me anything that matters to me. It's\nno comfort to me to be told I will survive, because after all, the soul\nis the key to personal identity, if there's no similar personality, no\nmemories, no beliefs, no retrievable memories of past lives. Then who\ncares that it's me?\n\nIf you can feel the force of that thought, then you're seeing how\nthe question \"Will I survive?\" can be separated out from the question\n\"What matters?\" What do we care about? Bare survival of my soul, even\nthough that is the key to personal identity--if it is--bare survival of\nmy soul doesn't give me what I want.\n\nIt's no more comforting or satisfying than if you said, \"You know\nthis knucklebone? After you die, we're going to do knucklebone surgery\nand implant that knucklebone in somebody else's body. And that\nknucklebone is going to survive.\" And I say, \"Oh, that's very\ninteresting that that knucklebone will be around 100 or 1,000 years\nfrom now. But who cares?\" And if the knucklebone theory of personal\nidentity gets proposed and somebody said, \"Oh, yes, but you see, that\nperson now with that knucklebone will be you, because the key to\npersonal identity is having the very same knucklebone.\" I say, \"All\nright, so it's me. Who cares?\" Bare knucklebone survival does not give\nme what matters.\n\nNow, the knucklebone theory of personal identity is a very stupid\ntheory. In contrast, the soul theory of personal survival is not a\nstupid theory. But for all that, it doesn't give me what I want. When\nyou think about the possibility of bare survival of the scrubbed,\nclean, erased soul, you see that survival wasn't really everything you\nwanted. What you wanted--at least what I want, I invite you to ask\nyourself whether you want the same thing--what I want is not just\nsurvival, but survival with the same personality. So even if the\nsoul theory is the correct theory of personality, it's not enough to\ngive me what matters. What matters isn't just survival. It's survival\nwith the same personality.\n\nLet's consider the body view. Suppose that the body theory of\npersonal identity is correct. And to be me, there's got to be somebody\nthere that's got my body. Let's suppose the brain version of the theory\nis the best version. And so next year, there's going to be somebody\nthat's got my brain. But let's imagine that the brain has been scrubbed\nclean. All memory traces have been completely erased. We're talking\ncomplete irreversible amnesia, complete erasure of the brain's hard\ndrive. No traces of desires and memories and intentions and beliefs to\neventually be recovered if only we have the right surgery, or\nprocedure, or psychotherapy, or what have you. It's gone.\n\nNow, that thing that wakes up after this complete irreversible\namnesia will no doubt eventually develop a personality, a set of\nbeliefs, memories. Nobody knows who it is, so they call it, they find\nit wandering on the streets. They call it John Doe. John Doe will\neventually have a bunch of beliefs about how the world works, make some\nplans, get some memories. According to the body theory, that's me. And\nif the body theory is correct, well by golly, it is me. And all I can\nsay in response to that is, it's me, but who cares? So what? I'm not\ncomforted by the thought that I will still be around 50 years from now,\nif the thing that's me doesn't have my personality.\n\nMere bodily survival isn't enough to give me what I want. I want\nmore than mere bodily survival. I want to survive with the same\npersonality. So even if the body theory of personal identity is the\nright theory, what I want to say in response to that is, \"So what?\" If\nthe really crucial question is not \"Do I survive,\" but \"Do I have what\nI wanted when I wanted to survive?\" the answer is the body theory\ndoesn't give it. I don't just want to survive. I want to survive with\nthe same personality.\n\nShould we conclude, therefore, that the key to the important\nquestion--namely, \"What matters?\"--the answer to that question, should\nwe conclude, is, same personality? That's a question we'll have to take\nup next time.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct14.html":{"url":"lct14.html","title":"Lecture 14","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 14 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nMarch 1, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: At the end of last class, I began to\nraise the question as to whether or not we should distinguish two\nquestions that we would normally be inclined to run together. We've\nbeen asking ourselves, what does it take for me to survive, for me to\ncontinue to exist? But it's possible, I suggested, that we really\nshouldn't focus on the question, what does it take for me to survive?\nbut rather, what is it that I care about? What is it that\nmatters in survival?\" Because it's possible, logically speaking,\nthat there could be cases in which I survive, but I don't have what I\nnormally have when I survive, and so I don't have what matters. I don't\nhave what I wanted, when I wanted to survive. It could be that in the\ntypical cases of survival I've got that extra thing. But we can think\nof cases in which I would survive, but I don't have that extra thing,\nand so I wouldn't have everything that matters to me. So as it were, we\nmight say, it might be that mere survival or bare bones survival\ndoesn't really give me what matters. What I want is survival plus\nsomething else.\n\nAnd I tried to motivate this question by having you think about\nperhaps the possibility, if the soul view was the truth about personal\nidentity, but imagine a case of complete irreversible amnesia, while\nnonetheless, it's still your soul continuing. But the soul is going to\nthen, having been scrubbed clean, get a brand new personality. A new\nset of memories, new set of desires, new set of beliefs. No chance of\nrecalling your previous, current, personality. And when I think about\nthat case, I find myself wanting to say, all right, I'll survive, but\nso what? I don't care. It doesn't matter that it's me, in that case.\nBecause I don't just want it to be me, I want to have there be somebody\nthat's me with my personality.\n\nSimilarly, suppose we thought that the body view was the correct\nview and we imagine, again, some sort of case of complete amnesia. And\nso then we get a new personality and you say, \"Oh look, that's going to\nbe you, your body, your brain. You're still around.\" And I say, \"It\ncould be true, but so what?\" It doesn't give me what I want, when I\nwant to survive. What I want isn't just for it to be me. I want it to\nbe me with my personality.\n\nSo should we conclude, therefore, that what really matters is not\njust survival but having the same personality? Would that--Suppose the\npersonality view of personality identity was correct. Would that then\ngive us not just personal survival, but what matters? I think that's\nclose, but no cigar. Not quite good enough.\n\nTo see that, recall the fact that according to the personality view,\nas a theory of personality identity, the crucial point isn't that my\npersonality stay identical. It's not that I have to keep all exactly\nthe very same beliefs, desires, and memories. Because of course, if we\nsaid that, then I'd die as soon as I got a new belief. I'd die as soon\nas I forgot anything at all of what I was doing 20 minutes ago. No,\naccording to the personality theory, what personal identity requires\nisn't item-for-item the same personality, but rather the same evolving\npersonality. I gain new beliefs, new desires, new goals. I may lose\nsome of my previous beliefs, lose some of my previous memories, but\nthat's okay as long as it's a slowly-evolving personality with enough\noverlap.\n\nOkay, so now let's consider the following case. I start off. Here I\nam. I've got a set of beliefs, a set of--I believe I'm Shelly Kagan, a\nset of memories about growing up in Chicago. I have a certain set of\ndesires about wanting to finish my book in philosophy and so forth. And\nI get older and older and older. And I get some new memories and some\nnew desires and some new goals. Suppose that I get very, very, very\nold. I get 100 years old, 200 years old, 300 years old. Somewhere\naround 200, suppose that my friends give me a nickname. They call me\nJo-Jo. Who knows why, they call me Jo-Jo. And after a while, somewhere\nthe name spreads and by the time I'm 250 years old, everybody's calling\nme Jo-Jo.\n\nNobody calls me Shelly anymore. And by the time I'm 300, 350, 400,\nI've forgotten anybody used to call me Jo-Jo [correction: Shelly\nKagan]. And I no longer remember growing up in Chicago. I remember\nthings about my youth when I was a lad of 100. But I can't go back to\nwhat it was like in the early days, just like you can't go back to what\nit was like to be four or three. And suppose that all this is going on\nas I'm getting older and older. My personality is changing in a variety\nof other ways. I lose my interest in philosophy and take up an interest\nin, I don't know, something that completely doesn't--organic chemistry\nholds no interest to me whatsoever. I become fascinated by the details\nof organic chemistry.\n\nAnd my values change. Now I'm a kind--now, over here--I'm a kind,\ncompassionate, warm individual who cares about the downtrodden. But\naround 300, I say, \"The downtrodden. Who needs them?\" And by the time\nI'm 500, I become completely self-absorbed and I'm sort of a vicious,\ncruel, vile person. Here I am, 800 years old, 900 years old.\n\nMethuselah, in the Bible, lives for 969 years. He's the oldest\nperson. So okay, here I am, 969 years old. I'm like Methuselah. Call\nthis the Methuselah case. And the crucial point about the case is that\nwe stipulate that at no point was there a dramatic change. It was all\ngradual, slow, evolving. In just the way it happens in real life. It's\njust that as Methuselah, I live a very, very, very long time. And by\nthe end of it, and indeed, let's say somewhere around 600 or 700, I'm a\ncompletely different person, as we might put it. I don't mean\nliterally. I mean in terms of my personality.\n\nNow, remember, according to the personality theory of personal\nidentity, what makes it me is the fact that it's the same evolving\npersonality. And I stipulated that it is the same evolving personality.\nSo that's still me that's going to be around 600 years from now, 700\nyears from now. But when I think about that case, I say, \"So what? Who\ncares?\" When I think about that case, I say, \"True, we'll just\nstipulate that will be me in 700 years. But it doesn't give me what I\nwant. That person is so completely unlike me. He doesn't remember being\nShelly Kagan. He doesn't remember growing up in Chicago. He doesn't\nremember my family. He has completely different interests and tastes\nand values.\" I say \"It's me, but so what? It doesn't give me what I\nwant. It doesn't give me what matters.\"\n\nWhen I think about what I want, it's not just that there be somebody\nat the tail end of an evolving personality. I want that person to be\nlike me, not just be me. I want that person to be like me. And\nin the Methuselah case, I've stipulated, it ends up not being very much\nlike me at all. So it doesn't give me what I want. When I think about\nwhat I want--and I'm just going to invite you to, each one of you, to\nask yourself what is it that you want, what matters to you in\nsurvival?--when I think about what matters to me, it's not just\nsurvival. It's not just survival as part of the same ongoing\npersonality. It's survival with a similar personality. Not\nidentical, item for item, but close enough to be fairly similar to me.\nGive me that, and I've got what matters. Don't give me that, and I\ndon't have what mattes.\n\nIn fact, I'm inclined to go a little bit further. Once you give me\nthat, give me that there's somebody there with my similar personality,\nI think that may be all that matters. Up to this moment, I've\nbeen saying, okay, survival by itself isn't good enough. You need\nsurvival plus something else. And I'm now suggesting that in my own\ncase at least, the something else is, something extra, is same, similar\npersonality. It might be that I get what matters to me even if I have,\nas long as I have, similar personality, even if I don't have\nsurvival.\n\nSuppose--I don't believe in souls, but suppose there really are\nsouls. And suppose the soul is the key to personal identity. And\nsuppose the thing that Locke was worried about really does happen.\nEvery day at midnight God destroys the old soul and replaces it with a\nnew soul that has the very same personality as the one before midnight,\nsimilar personality, same beliefs, desires, and so forth and so on. If\nI were to discover that's what was happening metaphysically and the\nsoul view was the true theory of personal identity, I'd say, \"Huh!\nTurns out I'm not going to survive tonight. I'm going to die. Who\ncares? There'll be somebody around tomorrow with my beliefs, my\ndesires, my goals, my ambitions, my fears, my values. Good enough. I\ndon't really care whether I'm going to survive. What I care about is\nwhether there'll be somebody that's similar to me in the right way in\nterms of my personality.\"\n\nSo it might be that the whole question we've been focusing on, \"What\ndoes it take to survive?\" may have turned out to be misguided. The real\nquestion may not be \"What does it take to survive?\" but \"What matters?\"\nAnd it might turn out that although, normally, having what matters goes\nhand in hand with surviving, logically speaking, they can come apart.\nAnd what matters, or so it seems to me, at least, isn't survival per\nse, but rather having the same personality.\n\nSince I'm inclined to think that the body view is the correct theory\nof personal identity, I want to say, look, somebody around tomorrow, if\novernight God replaces my body with some identical looking body and\nkeeps the personality the same, that won't be me, but all right. It's\ngood enough. What matters to me isn't survival per se. Indeed, isn't\nsurvival, strictly, at all. It's having the same personality.\n\nStill, what does that leave us? That leaves us with the possibility\nthat there could be cases where you die and you don't survive. Maybe\nGod swoops me up upon death. My body dies, but he sort of swoops up my\ninformation about my personality and recreates somebody up in heaven\nwith that similar personality. It won't be me, if it's a different\nsoul. It won't be me, if it's a different body. But still, I want to\nsay, it will give me what matters!\" That's a possibility. But I don't,\nin fact, think it's going to happen. I believe--I've told you I'm a\nphysicalist--I believe that what's going to happen is, at the death of\nmy body, that's going to be the end.\n\nNow, what I've been arguing is that, logically speaking, even if you\nare a physicalist, that doesn't rule out the possibility of survival.\nSuppose you believe in the personality theory. Your body's going to\ndie, but your personality could continue. Or it might be, even as a\nbody theorist, I'll cease to exist but what matters will continue.\nThese are possibilities. But for what it's worth, I don't in fact\nbelieve they're actually what's going to happen. Of course, these are\nalso theological matters, and so I'm not trying to say anything here\ntoday to argue you out of the theological conviction that God will\nresurrect the body or God will transplant your personality into some\nnew angel body, but if you believe in the personality theory, that will\nbe you, or what have you. I'm not--it's not my goal here to argue for\nor against these theological possibilities, having at least taken the\ntime to explain philosophically how we could make sense of them.\n\nBut I do want to report that I don't believe them. I believe that\nwhen my body dies, that's it for me. There won't be anything that's me\nafterwards. There won't be anything that's--even though what I want per\nse isn't survival. Not only won't I survive, I believe after my death\nwhat matters to me in that situation won't continue either. There won't\nbe somebody with a similar personality to mine after the death of my\nbody.\n\nAll right, so having spent all this time getting clearer about the\nnature of personal identity, and getting clearer about what people are,\nand the possibilities of survival, and so forth, having argued against\nthe existence of souls, and for a physicalist view--physicalism seems\ncompatible with both the body view and the personality view, leave it\nto you to decide between them, I myself currently favor the body\nview--let's ask, \"So just what is death, anyway, on the physicalist\nview?\"\n\nIt might seem as though it's fairly straightforward. A person, after\nall, is just a body that's functioning in the right way so as to do\nthese person tricks. It's P-functioning, as we've put it at one\ntime or another. And so a person is just a P-functioning body,\nwhether you emphasize the body side there or the personality side of\nthat equation.\n\nWhat exactly is it to die? When do I die? Let's turn to that\nquestion. When do I die and what is death? Roughly speaking, the\nanswer, presumably, on the physicalist view, is going to be something\nlike--if I'm alive when we've got a P-functioning body, roughly\nspeaking, I die when that stops happening, when the body breaks and it\nstops functioning properly. That seems, more or less, the right answer\nfrom the physicalist point of view, although as we'll see probably\nlater today, we need to refine it somewhat.\n\nBut first, let's ask a slightly different question. Which functions\nare crucial in defining the moment of death? After all, we've got the\nidea that here's the body, here's a functioning body. Here's one in\nfront of you. Each one of you has got one. You're a functioning body.\nThere's a variety of functions that your body's engaged in. Some of\nthem have to do with merely digesting food and moving the body around,\nand making the heart beat, and the lungs open and close. Call those\nthings the bodily functions. And there's also, of course, in each one\nof our cases, there's these higher mental cognitive functions that I've\nbeen calling the person functioning, there's the B-functions and\nthere's the P-functions.\n\nWell, roughly speaking, I die when the functioning stops, but which\nfunctions? Is it the body functions or the personality functions? So\nlet's take a look at the normal situation. Here's the existence of your\nbody. And during most of the existence of your body, it's functioning.\nThe body functions. Over here, it's no longer functioning. It's a\ncorpse. During some of the period when your body's functioning, it's\ndoing the higher cognitive stuff. The personality functions. Now, this\nis the very early stuff when your body's still developing and your\nbrain hasn't turned on yet, or your brain is turned on, but it hasn't\nactually become a person yet, right? At least in the case of the fetus,\nit's not self-conscious. It's not rational. It's not able to\ncommunicate. It's not creative and so forth. That comes later.\n\nAll right, so there's Phase A. There's Phase B. There's Phase C.\n[See Figure 14.1] That's the normal situation, the normal case. The\nbody exists. It functions for a while before the P-functioning\nbegins. And then after a while the body and P-functioning are\nboth going on. And then after a while they stop. In the normal case,\nI'm in a car accident or whatever it is, and my body stops functioning,\nmy personality stops functioning, and you're left with a corpse.\n\nWhen did I die? Well, the natural suggestion is to say I died here.\nI'll draw my little star, an asterisk. In the normal case, I die when\nmy body stops functioning, in terms of the body functions. And it stops\nfunctioning in terms of the personality functions. That's the normal\ncase. But we could still ask the philosophical question. Since what we\nhad here was simultaneously losing both the ordinary body functioning\nand the special personality functioning, which loss was the crucial one\nin terms of defining the moment of my death? Let's come back to that\nquestion in a minute.\n\nFirst, I want to ask a slightly different question. When did I cease\nto exist? Or, to put it slightly differently, do I exist during Phase\nC, when the body has stopped functioning? Both in terms of body\nfunctions and personality functions, I'm just a corpse. Do I exist?\n\nNow, let's suppose we believe the personality theory of personal\nidentity. According to the personality theory of personal identity, for\nsomething to be me, it's got to have the very same personality, the\nsame evolving, but still the same set of beliefs, desires, goals, so\nforth. Now, during period C, there's nothing with my personality,\nright? Nobody thinks they're Shelly Kagan. Nobody has my memories,\nbeliefs, exact desires, goals and so forth. Pretty clearly then, on the\npersonality theory, I don't exist at Phase C. That's why it's natural\nto point to the moment of star when we say that's when my death occurs.\nI don't exist at Phase C.\n\nBut interestingly, things look rather different if we accept not the\npersonality theory, but instead, the body theory. After all, according\nto the body theory of personal identity, for somebody to be me, they've\ngot to have my body. Follow the body. Same body, same person. All\nright, here we are. Here's my corpse. What is a corpse? It's a body,\nand indeed, my corpse is my body. So follow the body means\nfollow the person. The corpse is still around. It means my body's still\naround. It means I'm still around. It's like, I mean, I'm dead,\nbut I still exist. It's like a bad joke, right?\n\nSo here's the question we started the class off with. Will you\nsurvive your death? Will you still exist after death? Well, there's\ngood news and there's bad news. Since I believe in the body theory, the\ngood news is, you will exist after your death. The bad news is, you'll\nbe a corpse. That seems like a bad joke, but if the body theory is\nright, it's not a joke at all. It's literally speaking the truth. I\nwill exist, at least for a while. Eventually, the body will decay, turn\ninto atoms or whatever it is, decompose. At that point my body no\nlonger exists. At that point, I will no longer exist. But at least for\na while,during period C, the body theorist should say, \"Yeah, you will\nexist. You will exist, but you won't be alive.\"\n\nIt just reinforces the point that I was trying to make a few moments\nago that the crucial question is not survival per se. The crucial\nquestion is, what did you want out of survival? And one of the things I\nwanted out of survival was to be alive. All right, so on the\nbody view, I exist here, but I'm not alive, so it doesn't give me what\nmatters. On the personality view, I don't exist when I'm a corpse.\n\nLet's go back and ask the question, well, so which is it? Which is\nthe one that's the crucial for defining the moment of death, right?\nEven on the body view, the fact that I exist isn't good enough, because\nI'm not alive. I want to know, when am I alive? When am I dead?\n\nSo what's crucial for defining the moment of death? Is it body\nfunctioning or personality functioning? Well, you can't tell by\nthinking about the normal case, because the B-functioning and\nthe P-functioning stop at the same time. But suppose we draw the\nabnormal case. All right, here's C with the corpse again. Here's a\nperiod when the body's been functioning and goes like this. Here's the\nperiod back here, A, where the body's been functioning, but the\npersonality hasn't started yet. And now imagine, so this is\npersonality. Over here we've got body. We'll call this B again. [See\nFigure 14.2]\n\nWhat I've done is imagine a case in which the personality\nfunctioning stops before the rest of the body functioning stops.\nObviously, the phases are no longer in alphabetical order, but I\nintroduced D in the middle so the other phases could keep their same\nlabels. Well, here's a case where--When does the body functioning stop?\nEnd of D. When does the personality functioning stop? End of B. So\nwe've got two candidates. Star one and star two. Star one says death\noccurs when personality stops functioning. Star two says no, no, death\noccurs when bodily functioning stops.\n\nWell, again, the question is, what should we say? I think we're\ngoing to perhaps be drawn to different answers, depending on whether we\naccept the body view or the personality view. Suppose we accept the\nbody view. Well, look, if the relevant question is \"When do I die?\" and\nI am a body, then presumably the straightforward answer at least is\ngoing to be \"I die when my body stops functioning.\" When is that? Star\ntwo. During period D, I'm still alive, but I'm no longer functioning as\na person. I am no longer a person. That's interesting. It's not just\nthat I exist. In C, I can exist without being a corpse; or\nrather, without being alive, as a corpse. In D, I'm alive but I'm not a\nperson.\n\nYou recall when we talked about Plato, we introduced the notion of\nessential properties. And it seems that if we accept the body view, we\nhave to say being a person is not an essential property of being\nsomething like me. It's not one of my essential properties that I'm a\nperson. I am, in fact, a person, but that won't always be true of me.\nWhen I'm a corpse, I will cease to be a person, but I'll still exist.\nAnd if we have this unusual case in which my brain has a stroke, loses\nits higher cognitive functioning, so that the body continues to\nbreathe, eat, respirate, and so forth, the heart continues to pump, but\nthere's no longer anything capable of thinking, reasoning, we say,\nlook, I still exist. Indeed, I'm alive, but I'm not a person. Being a\nperson is something you can go through for a period of time and cease\nto be. In the same way that being a child is a phase you can go through\nfor a period of time and then cease to be. Or being a professor is a\nphase you can go through and then cease to be. You can still exist\nwithout being a professor. I can still be alive without being a\nprofessor.\n\nWell, on the body view, we have to say the same thing about being a\nperson. Being a person is something that I, namely my body, can do for\na while. It wasn't doing it back here in A. It certainly won't be doing\nit in C. And it won't be doing it in D either. Being a person is\nsomething on the body view that I am only for part of my existence and\nindeed, only for part of my life.\n\nWell, that's what it seems we should say on the body view. What if\ninstead we accept the personality theory? Then--actually, one more\nremark about the body view. Notice that if you accept this account of\nwhat the body view should say about when death is, my death is when I\ncease to be alive. I am my body. So my death occurs at star two, loss\nof bodily function. And being a person is just a phase.\n\nNotice that if we say that, then there's something somewhat\nmisleading about the standard philosophical label for the problems\nwe've been thinking about for the last couple of weeks. We've been\nworrying about the nature of personal identity. That is to say, what is\nit for somebody to be me. But notice that that label, \"personal\nidentity,\" \"the problem of personal identity,\" seems to have built into\nit the assumption that whatever it is that's me is going to be a\nperson. Is it the same person or not? Now, it turns out that\nthat assumption, standardly built into the usual label, may be false.\nOn the body view, it could still be me without being a person at all.\nSo the problem of existence through time, or persistence through time,\nshouldn't be called the problem of personal identity, but just the\nproblem of identity. You know, a footnote.\n\nTurning now again to the personality theory. If we accept the\npersonality theory of personal identity, then for someone to be me,\nthey've got to have the same personality. And so for something, for me\nto exist, my personality has to be around. Well, that's why we said up\nhere that in Phase C when there's a corpse, I don't exist. There's\nnothing with my personality. As a corpse, I no longer exist.\n\nWhat should we say about Phase D, on the personality theory? Here,\nmy body is functioning, but my personality has been destroyed. Nothing\nexists with my beliefs, memories, desires, fears, values, goals,\nambitions. Well, if I just am my personality, then I don't exist in\nPhase D, because there's nothing there to be me, nothing with my\npersonality. According to the personality theory, follow the\npersonality. The personality ended at star one. So I don't exist at\nPhase D on the personality theory.\n\nOkay good. I don't exist. But what should we say? Am I alive or not?\nWell, my body's still alive. So should we say that I'm alive?\nAfter all, my body's still functioning until star two. During Phase D,\nmy body seems to still be alive. Should we say that I'm alive?\nThat's rather hard to believe, right? Think about what it would mean to\nsay that. We'd being saying on the personality theory, I don't exist,\nbut I'm alive. That seems like a very unpalatable combination of views.\nHow can I be alive if I don't even exist? So it seems we have to say\nI'm not alive during Phase D. Not only don't I exist during Phase D,\nI'm not alive either. Yet, my body is alive; that's the whole\nstipulation.\n\nSo it looks as though the personality theorist is going to have to\nintroduce a distinction between my being alive, on the one hand, and my\nbody being alive, on the other. In the normal case--up at the top,\nthose two deaths occur simultaneously. My body stops being alive at the\nvery same moment that I cease being alive. But in the abnormal case,\nthe personality theorist needs to say, or so it seems to me, the two\ndeaths come apart. The death of my body occurs at star two. My death\noccurs at star one. Notice that the body theorist didn't need to draw\nthat distinction. Because if I just am my body, then well, I'm just my\nbody. My death occurs at the death of my body.\n\nBut still, even the body theorist needs a different distinction. We\nalready learned, by thinking about the corpse case, that existence\nwasn't good enough for the body theorist. He wanted to be alive. And\nwhen I think about Phase D, I want to say something more. It's not good\nenough that I'm alive. I want to be a person. So what matters to me\nisn't just being alive, but being back here during Phase B. So then it\nneeds something like the same distinction. Not, my death versus my\nbody's death, but perhaps the death of the person, if we could talk\nthat way, versus the death of the body. My death, for the body view,\noccurs with the death of my body. But in terms of what matters, it's\nthe death of the person and that's star one, not star two.\n\nNow, I want to take just a couple of minutes and mention some other\npuzzles, or at least questions, worth thinking about in terms of the\nphysicalist picture. I'm only going to point to them, rather than\nexplore them. But I've been focused on the question about the end of\nlife. We might ask as well, what about the beginning? What should we\nsay about Phase A, when the body is turned on and functioning,\ndeveloping, but the brain has not yet gotten to the stage at which it's\nturned on, or perhaps it hasn't yet become, well, it's not doing person\nfunctioning. It's not reasoning. It's not communicating. It's not\nthinking. It's not aware. It's not conscious. There's going to be some\nPhase A like that. What should we say about that phase? Do I exist\nduring that phase or don't I?\n\nWell, on the body view, I suppose we should say I do exist. Being a\nperson is a phase. We happen to have, in Phase A, the stage of my\nexistence before I become a person.\n\nOf course, if we take the version of the body view that what I am,\nessentially--the crucial body part--is my brain, then we really would\nhave to subdivide A into two parts: early A and late A. In very, very\nearly A, the brain hasn't even developed yet. It hasn't been\nconstructed yet. If I just am my brain, in effect, then early A, I\ndon't exist yet. Not until late A, when the brain gets put together,\nthat I start to exist. There is something there. It's my body, but it's\nnot me, in early A. It seems sort of hard to believe, but maybe that's\nthe right thing to say.\n\nIn any event, the fans of the personality theory shouldn't be\nlaughing too hard, because they're going to have to say something\nsimilar. Remember, if you accept the personality theory, follow the\npersonality. Don't got the same personality? I cease to exist. That's\nwhy we said on the personality theory, as we went ahead in time, once\nthe P-functioning stops, I don't exist anymore. That's what the\npersonality theorist said.\n\nBut we can raise that same point going backwards. When did I begin\nto exist on the personality theory? Not until my continuing, evolving\nthrough time personality started. And that certainly wasn't true way\nback at the start of A, as the fertilized egg first begins to split and\nmultiply, subdivide and make organs. It's a good long time till any\nkind of mental processing occurs at all. So on the personality theory,\nI did not exist when that fertilized egg came into being, when the egg\nand the sperm joined. That's still not me, on the personality\ntheory.\n\nClearly, these issues are relevant for thinking about the morality\nof abortion. I'm not going to pursue them here, but you can see how\nthey'd be relevant. If we want to worry about when, if ever, is an\nabortion justified, it might be worth getting clear on, when do\ncreatures like us start? Interesting question, but having noted it, let\nme put it aside. Ah, question.\n\nStudent: [inaudible]\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: The question was: Would it be\nplausible to say that at the early phases of A, strictly speaking, the\nbody's not functioning, because it's so utterly dependent on help from\nthe mother's body. It needs the mother for respiration, for nutrients,\nand so forth and so on. That's a great question. And it's the sort of\nquestion and the reason why I said I wanted to glance in this direction\nwithout really going there. That's a nice example of it. We might\nwonder, just when should we say the body functioning really does start?\nHow much independence does it take? We could draw yet another picture\nof a different way a life could come to an end. Imagine a body towards\nthe end of life, on life support machinery. Do we want to say the\nbody's functioning or not functioning? Well, hard cases there. So\nsimilarly, there's going to be hard cases about the very, very early\nstages. And although they're great questions and I'm happy to discuss\nthem with you further, I don't want to pursue them here and now.\n\nI want to point to a different question that--I think it's a\ncrucially important question. My unwillingness to discuss them isn't a\nmatter of my judgment that they're unimportant, just trying to keep at\nleast roughly on track. Come back to the end of life. Think some more\nabout Phase D and ask. All right, so this is something that's--If the\npersonality function's been destroyed, can't be recovered, can't be\nfixed, but the rest of the bodily functioning is still going on. The\nheart's pumping, the lungs are breathing and so forth. The body's able\nto digest food. There we are in Phase D, in something like, perhaps,\npersistent vegetative state.\n\nNow, imagine that we've got somebody who needs a heart transplant or\na kidney transplant, liver transplant. And tissue compatibility tests\nreveal this body's compatible, suitable donor. Can we take it or not?\nWell, you might have thought we answer that by asking \"Am I still\nalive?\" Well, rip out the heart, it's going to kill me, right? So if\nI'm still alive, you can't do that sort of thing. It's killing me.\nWell, if we take the personality theory, we have to say, my body's\nstill alive, but I'm not still alive. That's what we seem to want to\nsay. If I'm not still alive, all we'd be killing isn't me, but my\nbody.\n\nSo now we have to ask, who or what has the right to life? Do\nI have the right to life, or does my body have the right\nto life? Or we might say, look, certainly I have a right to life. But\nis it also true that in addition to me, my body has a right to life? Is\nthere something immoral about removing the organs during Phase D when\nthe person is dead and the only thing that's still alive is the\nbody?\n\nDon't be too quick to assume the answer that's got to be yeah, it's\nstill wrong. After all, on the body view, I still exist when I'm a\ncorpse. But of course, there's nothing wrong about taking my heart,\neven though I still exist. After all, I'm a corpse. Why not then say,\nsimilarly, even though my body's still alive, nothing wrong about\nremoving the heart if the person is dead. At least, the personality\nview opens the door to saying that.\n\nWhat about the body view? On the body view, of course, I just am my\nbody. I'm still alive. Now is it wrong? Well... Just like, with the\nbody view, we wanted to say, \"Being alive is not all it's cracked up to\nbe,\" the real question is not, am I alive, on the body view? An\ninteresting question is, \"Am I still a person?\" And indeed, although\nI'm alive on the body view, I'm not still a person. Maybe it's not so\nmuch that I have a right not to be killed. Maybe I have a right\nnot to be depersonified, to have my personality destroyed. If that's\nthe real right, then again, there'd be nothing wrong with removing the\nheart in D. Well, again, clearly, very, very important and very, very\ncomplicated questions. But having gestured toward them, I want to put\nthem aside.\n\nInstead, I want to raise the following question. So look, what I've\njust been talking about for the last half hour or so is the fact that\nwe've got to get clear, in thinking about the nature of death, as to\nwhether or not the crucial moment is the moment when the personality\nfunctioning stops or the moment when the bodily functioning stops. As\nwe saw by thinking about the abnormal case, these things can come apart\nand we can have Phase D. But in the normal case, they happen at the\nsame moment. And I've drawn a lot of different distinctions about what\nwould you say if you're a personality theorist to deal with this? What\nwould you say if you're a body theorist to deal with this? Having drawn\nall those distinctions, I'm going to just ride roughshod over them and\nput them aside. And let's just suppose that we're dealing with the\nnormal case, where the body functioning stops at the same time as the\npersonality functioning stops.\n\nSo what is death? What's the moment of death? What is it to die, on\nthe physicalist view? Well, at first glance, you might think the answer\nis, look, you exist, you're alive, whatever it is--;as I said, I'm just\ngoing to be loose now, I'm going to put aside all the careful\ndistinctions I just drew--I'm still around as long as my body is\nP-functioning. And when my body's not P-functioning, I'm\nnot still around. Either I don't exist or I'm not alive or I'm not a\nperson, whichever precise way we have to put it. That seems like the\nnatural proposal for the physicalist to make. To be dead is to no\nlonger be P-functioning. But that can't quite be right. Because\nimagine, don't just imagine, just remember what happened to you last\nnight around 3:20 a.m. Let's just suppose that at 3:20 a.m. you were\nasleep and indeed, you weren't dreaming. You weren't thinking. You\nweren't reasoning. You weren't communicating. You weren't remembering.\nYou weren't making plans. You weren't being creative. You were not\nengaged in P-functioning.\n\nIf we take this simple straightforward view and say you're dead when\nyou're not P-functioning anymore, then you were dead, on and off\nand on and off, last night. Well, that clearly doesn't seem to be the\nright thing to say. So we're going to have to revise the\nP-functioning or the end of P-functioning theory of\ndeath. We're going to have to revise that theory. We're going to have\nto refine it to deal with the obvious fact that you're not dead all the\ntimes when you're unconscious and not dreaming. But refining in just\nthe right way is going to turn out to be a surprisingly not\nstraightforward matter, at least that's how it seems to me. At any\nrate, that's the question we'll turn to next time.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct15.html":{"url":"lct15.html","title":"Lecture 15","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 15 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nMarch 6, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Last time we ended with the following\npuzzle or question. If we say that to be a person is to be a\nP-functioning body, it seems then as though we have to conclude\nthat when you're not P-functioning, you're dead. That is, you're\ndead as a person. Previously, we distinguished between the death of my\nbody and my death as a person; let's focus on my death as a person. If\nI'm not P-functioning, do we have to then say I'm dead?\n\nWell, that may seem to be the most natural way to define death, but\nit's not an acceptable approach. Because it would follow then, that\nwhen I'm asleep, I'm dead. Well, not during those times, perhaps, when\nI'm dreaming while I'm asleep. But think of the various periods during\nthe night in which you are in a deep, deep dreamless sleep. You're not\nthinking. You're not planning. You're not communicating. Let's just\nsuppose, as seems likely, that none of the P-functioning is\noccurring, at some point during sleep. Should we say then that you're\ndead? Well, that's clearly not the right thing to say.\n\nSo we need to revise our account of what it is on the physicalist\npicture to say that you're dead. What is it to be dead? It can't just\nbe a matter of not P-functioning. Well, one possibility would be\nto say, the question is not whether you are P-functioning. It's\nokay if you're not P-functioning, as long as your not\nP-functioning is temporary. If you will P-function again,\nif you have been P-functioning in the past and you will be\nP-functioning again in the future, P-functioning for\nperson functioning, you will be P-functioning again in the\nfuture, then you're not dead. Well, that's at least an improvement,\nbecause then we say, look, while you're asleep, even though there's no\nP-functioning going on, the lack of P-functioning is\ntemporary, so you're still alive.\n\nBut I think that won't quite do either. Let's suppose that come\nJudgment Day, God will resurrect the dead. And let's just suppose the\ncorrect theory of personal identity is such as to put aside any worries\nwe might have along with van Inwagen, that we discussed previously, as\nto whether or not on resurrection day that would really be you or not.\nSuppose it would be you. So God will resurrect the dead. Judgment Day\ncomes. The dead are resurrected. Well, now they're\nP-functioning. So it turns out that during that period in which\nthey were dead, they were only temporarily not P-functioning.\nBut if death means permanent cessation of P-functioning, then it\nturns out the dead weren't really dead after all. They were only\ntemporarily not P-functioning, just like we are temporarily not\nP-functioning when we're asleep. Well, that doesn't seem right\neither. On Judgment Day, God resurrects the dead. It's not that\nHe simply wakes up those in a deep, deep sleep. So the proposal that\ndeath is a matter of permanent cessation of P-functioning versus\ntemporary, that doesn't seem like it's going to do the trick. But what\nelse do we have up our sleeves?\n\nHere's a different proposal that I think is probably closer to the\nright account. We might say, look, while you're asleep, it's true that\nyou're not P-functioning. For example, you're not doing your\nmultiplication tables. But although you are not engaged in\nP-functioning, it does seem true to say that you still can\nP-function. You still could do your multiplication\ntables. Although it's not true that you are speaking French--let's\nsuppose that you know how to speak French--it's still true of you while\nyou're asleep that you can or could speak French. How do we know this?\nWell, all we have to do is just wake you up. We wake you up and we say,\n\"Hey John, what's three times three?\" And after you stop swearing at\nus, you say, \"Well, it's nine.\" Or we say, \"Linda, hey, conjugate such\nand such a verb in French.\" And you can conjugate it. Even though you\nwere not engaged in P-functioning while you were asleep, it's\nstill true that while you were asleep, you had the ability to engage in\nP-functioning.\n\nAbilities aren't always actualized. Your P-functioning is\nactualized now, because you're engaged in thought, but you don't lose\nthe ability to think during those moments when you're not thinking.\nSuppose we say then that to be alive as a person is to be able to\nengage in P-functioning. And to be dead then, is to be unable to\nengage in P-functioning. Why are you unable? Well, presumably\nbecause whatever cognitive structures it takes in your brain to\nunderwrite the ability to P-function, those cognitive structures\nhave been broken, so they no longer work. It's--When you're dead, your\nbrain is broken. It's not just that you're not engaged in\nP-functioning, you're no longer able to engage in\nP-functioning.\n\nThat, at least, seems to handle the case of sleep properly. Although\nyou're not engaged in P-functioning, you're able to, so you're\nstill alive. Take the dead who will be resurrected on Judgment Day.\nAlthough they will be engaged in P-functioning later on, it's\nnot true right now that they can engage in P-functioning.\nTheir bodies and brains are broken until God fixes them. So they're\ndead.\n\nAll right, that seems to give the right answer and, in fact, it\ngives us some guidance how to think about some other puzzling cases.\nTake somebody who is in a coma, not engaged in P-functioning.\nTheir body, let's stipulate, is still alive. Their heart's still\nbeating, the lungs are still breathing and so forth. But we wonder, is\nthe person still alive? Does the person still exist? Well, they're not\nengaged in P-functioning. That's pretty clear. We want to know,\ncan they engage in P-functioning?\n\nNow, at this point we'd want to know more about the underlying\nmechanics about what's gone on in the case of the coma. If the\nfollowing is the right description, then we perhaps should say they're\nstill alive. Look, when somebody's asleep, we need to do something to,\nin effect, wake them up, something to turn the functioning back on. The\ncognitive structures are still there, but the on-off switch is switched\nto off. Perhaps that's what it's like when somebody's in a coma, or\nperhaps at least certain types of comas. Of course, to turn the on-off\nswitch on is harder when somebody's in a coma. It's a bit more--to\ncontinue with the metaphor of the on-of switch--as though not only is\nthe switch turned to off, there's a lock on the switch. And so we can't\nturn the switch on in the normal way. Pushing the person in the coma\nand saying, \"Wake up, Jimmy\" doesn't do the trick. But for all that,\nalthough the on-off switch may be stuck in off, if the underlying\ncognitive structures of the brain are such as to still make it true\nthat, flip the on switch back to on and the person can still engage in\ncognitive P-functioning, maybe the right thing to say is the\nperson's still alive.\n\nComa case two. I'm not sure whether this really should be called a\ncoma. I don't know the biological and medical details. But imagine that\nwhat's gone on is there's been decay of the brain structures that\nunderwrite the cognitive functioning. So now it's not just that the\non-off switch is stuck in off, the brain's no longer capable of\nengaging in these higher order P-functions. This might be a\npersistent vegetative state with no possibility of turning it on, even\nin principle. Of such a person we might say, they're no longer capable\nof P-functioning. And then perhaps the right thing to say is the\nperson no longer exists, so they no longer exist as a person, even if\nthe body is still alive. So far, so good.\n\nHere's a harder case to think about. Suppose we put somebody in a\nstate of suspended animation, cool their body down so that the various\nmetabolic processes come to an end. They stop. As I'm sure you know,\nwe're able, with various lower organisms, to put them in a state of\nsuspended animation and then, the amazing thing is, if you heat them\nback up again properly, they start functioning again. Now, we can't do\nthat yet with humans. But it doesn't jump out at us, at least, that\nthat should be an impossibility. So suppose we eventually learn how to\ndo this with humans. And now, suppose we take Larry and put him in a\nstate of suspended animation. Is he dead? Well, most of us don't feel\ncomfortable saying that he's dead. Just like we don't feel comfortable\nsaying that the--I suppose we could do this with a fruit fly. I don't\nknow whether we can or can't. Suppose we can. Suppose we do it with a\nfruit fly. We don't feel comfortable saying the fruit fly's dead.\nRather, it's in a state of suspended animation. Well, similarly then,\nperhaps we wouldn't want to say that Larry is dead. And the\n\"brokenness\" account of death allows us to say Larry's not dead. The\nstructures in the brain which would underwrite the ability to engage in\nP-functioning, they're not destroyed by suspended animation. So\nperhaps in the relevant sense, the person can still engage in\nP-functioning, so they're not dead. Good enough.\n\nOn the other hand, it doesn't seem so plausible, it doesn't seem\nintuitively right, to say that they're alive. Is Larry alive when he's\nin a state of suspended animation? No. It seems like he's not alive\neither. Now that's a bit puzzling, right? It's as though we\nneed--Normally, we think that look, either you're alive or you're dead.\nThe two possibilities exhaust the possibilities. But thinking about\nsuspended animation suggests that we may actually need a third\ncategory, suspended--neither alive nor dead.\n\nWell, all right, if we do introduce a third possibility--I'm not\nsure this is the right thing. It's not clear what's the right or best\nthing to say about suspended animation. But at least that doesn't seem\nlike an unattractive possibility. If there are three\npossibilities--dead, alive, or suspended--to be dead, we could still\nsay you've got to be broken, incapable of P-functioning.\nSuspended isn't broken. It's just suspended. But then what do you need\nto be alive? In addition to not being broken, what do you need to be\nalive? Well, the initially tempting thing to say is not only aren't you\nbroken, but you're actually engaged in P-functioning. But if we\nsay that, then we're back to saying that somebody who's asleep isn't\nreally alive. That doesn't seem right either. So we need some account\nto distinguish between suspended animation and out and out being alive.\nAnd I'm not quite sure how to draw that line. So I'll leave that to you\nas a puzzle to work on on your own.\n\nThat puzzle aside, it seems to me that once we become physicalists,\nthere's nothing especially deep or mysterious about death. The body is\nable to function in a variety of ways. When some of those lower\nbiological functions are occurring, the body's alive. When all goes\nwell, the body is also capable of engaging in higher order personal\nP-functioning. And then you've got a person. The body begins to\nbreak, you get the loss of P-functioning. At that point, you no\nlonger exist as a person. When the body breaks some more, you get the\nloss of biological or B-functioning, and then the body dies.\nThere's nothing especially mysterious about death, although there may\nbe a lot of details to work out from a scientific point of view. What\nare the particular processes that underwrite biological functioning?\nWhat are the particular processes that underwrite personality or person\nfunctioning?\n\nStill, there are a couple of claims about death that get made\nfrequently enough, about death being mysterious in one way or another,\nthat I want--or special or unique--that I want to focus on. In effect,\nfrom the physicalist point of view, although death is unique because it\ncomes at the end of this lifetime of various sorts of functions,\nthere's nothing especially puzzling, nothing especially mysterious,\nnothing especially unusual or hard to grasp about it. But there are a\nhandful of claims that people make about death suggesting that they\nthink, and they think we all think, that death is mysterious or unique\nor hard to comprehend. I want to examine a couple of these.\n\nOne of them I'll get to later; if not later today, then next\nlecture. Sometimes people say that we die alone or everybody\ndies alone. And this is something--This is supposed to express some\ndeep insight into the nature and uniqueness of death. So although we're\nable to eat meals together, we're able to go on vacations together and\ntake classes together, death is something we all have to do by\nourselves. That's the claim. We all die alone. That's a claim I'll come\nback to.\n\nWhat I want to look at first is the suggestion that somehow, at some\nlevel, nobody really believes they're going to die at all. Now, having\ndistinguished between what we've called the death of the body and the\ndeath of the person, the question whether or not you're going to die\nneeds to be distinguished. The question whether or not you believe\nyou're going to die needs to be distinguished. If somebody says, \"You\nknow, nobody really believes they're going to die,\" they could mean one\nof two things. They could mean nobody really believes they're going to\ncease to exist as a person, first possibility. Second possible claim,\nnobody really believes they're going to undergo the death of their\nbodies. Let's take these in turn.\n\nIs there any good reason to believe that we don't believe that we're\ngoing to cease to exist as a person? Well, the most common argument for\nthis claim I think takes the following form. People sometimes say,\nsince it's impossible to picture being dead, it's impossible to picture\nbeing dead--, That is to say, it's impossible to picture your own being\ndead. Each one of us has to think about this from the first person\nperspective or something like that. Think about your dying, your being\ndead--Since that's impossible to picture, that's impossible to imagine,\nnobody believes in the possibility that they're going to die, that\nthey're going to cease to exist.\n\nThe idea seems to be that you can't believe in possibilities that\nyou can't picture or imagine. Now, that hypothesis, that thesis, that\nassumption, could be challenged. I think probably we shouldn't believe\nthe theory of belief which says that in order to believe in something,\nyou've got to be able to picture it or believe it. But let's grant that\nassumption for the sake of argument. Let's suppose that in order to\nbelieve in something, you've got to be able to picture it. What then?\nHow do we get from there to the conclusion that I can't believe that\nI'm going to die, I'm going to cease to exist as a person? Well, the\nthought, of course, is I can't picture or imagine my death. I can't\npicture or imagine my being dead.\n\nIt's important here to draw some distinctions. I can certainly\npicture being ill. There I am on my deathbed dying of cancer, growing\nweaker and weaker. I can perhaps even picture the moment of my death.\nI've said goodbye to my family and friends. I've the--Everything's\ngrowing greyer and dimmer. It's growing harder and harder to\nconcentrate. And then, well, and then there is no \"and more.\" The\nclaim, however, is not that I can't picture being ill or dying. The\nclaim's got to be, I can't picture being dead. Well, try it. Try\nto picture being dead. What's it like to be dead?\n\nSometimes people claim it's a mystery. We don't know what it's like\nto be dead, because every time we try to imagine it, we fail. We don't\ndo a very good job. I'm inclined to think that that way of thinking\nabout the question is really confused. You set yourself the goal of\ntrying to put yourself in the situation imaginatively of what it's like\nto be dead. So I start by trying to strip off the parts of my conscious\nlife that I know I won't have when I'm dead. I won't hear anything. I\nwon't see anything. I won't think anything. And you try to imagine what\nit's like to not think or feel or hear or see. And you don't do a very\ngood job of it. So you throw your hands up and you say, \"Oh, I guess I\ndon't know what it's like.\" So it must be a mystery.\n\nIt's not a mystery at all. Suppose I ask, \"What's it like to be this\ncell phone?\" The answer is, \"It's not like anything,\" where that\ndoesn't mean there's something that it's like to be a cell phone, but\ndifferent from being anything else. So it's not like anything else;\nit's a special way of feeling or experiencing. No. Cell phones\ndon't have any experience at all. There is nothing that it's\nlike on the inside to be a cell phone. Imagine that I try to ask\nmyself, \"What's it like to be my ball point pen?\" And I try to imagine,\nwell, first, imagine being really, really stiff, because you're not\nflexible when you're a ball point pen. You can't move. And imagine\nbeing really, really bored, because you don't have any thoughts or\ninterests. No. That's completely the wrong way to go about thinking\nwhat it's like to be a ball point pen. There's nothing that it's\nlike to be a ball point pen. There's nothing to describe, nothing to\nimagine. No mystery about what it's like to be a ball point pen. No\nmystery about what it's like to be a cell phone.\n\nWell, similarly then, I put it to you, there's no mystery about what\nit's like to be dead. It isn't like anything. What I don't mean, \"Oh,\nit's like something, but different from everything else.\" I mean, there\nis nothing there to describe. When you're dead, there's nothing\nhappening on the inside to be imagined. Well, should we conclude\ntherefore, given that we've got the premise, \"If you can't picture it\nor imagine it, then you can't believe in it,\" since I've just said,\nlook, you can't imagine being dead, but that's not due to any failure\nof imagination, that's because there's nothing there to imagine or\npicture. Still, granted the premise, if you can't picture it or imagine\nit, you can't believe in it--Should we conclude, therefore, that you\ncan't believe you're going to be dead? No. We shouldn't conclude\nthat.\n\nAfter all, not only is it true that you can't picture from the\ninside what it's like to be dead, you can't picture from the inside\nwhat it's like to be in dreamless sleep. There is nothing that\nit's like to be in dreamless sleep. When you're in dreamless sleep,\nyou're not imagining or experiencing anything. Similarly, it's not\npossible to picture or imagine what it's like to have fainted and be\ncompletely unconscious with nothing happening cognitively. There's\nnothing to picture or imagine. Well, should we conclude, therefore, so\nnobody really believes that they're ever in dreamless sleep? Well, that\nwould be silly. Of course you believe that at times you're in dreamless\nsleep. Should we say of somebody who's fainted or knows that they're\nsubject to fainting spells, they never actually believe that they pass\nout? That would be silly. Of course, they believe they pass out.\n\nFrom the mere fact that they can't picture it from the inside, it\ndoesn't follow that nobody believes they're ever in dreamless sleep.\nFrom the mere fact that they can't picture from the inside what it's\nlike to have fainted and not yet woken up, it doesn't mean that nobody\nbelieves that they ever faint. From the mere fact that you can't\npicture from the inside what it's like to be dead, it doesn't follow\nthat nobody believes they're going to die.\n\nBut didn't I start off by saying I was going to grant the person who\nis making this argument that in order to believe something, you've got\nto be able to picture it? And haven't I just said, \"Look, you can't\npicture being dead\"? So aren't I taking it back? Since I say you can\nbelieve you're going to die, yet you can't picture it from the inside.\nHaven't I taken back the assumption that in order to believe it, you've\ngot to be able to picture it? Not quite.\n\nAlthough I am skeptical about that claim, I am going to continue\ngiving it to the person who makes this argument, because I'm not so\nprepared to admit that you can't picture being dead. You can picture\nbeing dead, all right. You just can't picture it from the inside. You\ncan picture it from the outside. I can picture being in\ndreamless sleep quite easily. I'm doing it right now. I've got a little\nmental image of my body lying in bed asleep, dreamlessly. I can picture\nfainting, or having fainted, quite easily. Picture my body lying on the\nground unconscious. I can picture my being dead quite easily. It's a\nlittle mental picture of my body in a coffin. No functioning occurring\nin my body. So even if it were true that belief requires picturing, and\neven if were true that you can't picture being dead from the inside, it\nwouldn't follow that you can't believe you're going to die. All you\nhave to do is picture it from the outside. We're done. So I conclude,\nof course you can and do believe you're going to die.\n\nBut at this point, the person making the argument has a possible\nresponse. And it's a quite common response. He says, \"Look, I try to\npicture the world--admittedly from the outside--I try to picture the\nworld in which I don't exist, I'm no longer conscious. I'm no longer a\nperson, no longer experiencing anything. I try to picture that world. I\npicture, for example, seeing my funeral. And yet, when I try to do\nthat, I'm observing it. I'm watching the funeral. I'm seeing the\nfuneral. Consequently, I'm thinking. So I haven't really imagined the\nworld in which I no longer exist, a world in which I'm dead, a world in\nwhich I'm incapable of thought and observation. I've smuggled myself\nback in as the observer of the funeral.\"\n\nEvery time I try to picture myself being dead, I smuggle myself back\nin, conscious and existing as a person, hence, not dead as a person.\nMaybe my body--I'm imagining my body dead, but I'm not imagining\nmyself, the person, dead. From which it follows, the argument goes,\nthat I don't really believe I'll ever be dead. Because when I try to\nimagine a world in which I'm dead, I smuggle myself back in.\n\nThis argument shows up in various places. Let me mention, let me\nquote one case of it, Freud. Freud says, this is, I'm quoting from one\nof the Walter Kaufman essays that you'll be reading, called \"Death.\" He\nquotes Freud. Freud says,\n\nAfter all, one's own death is beyond imagining, and\nwhenever we try to imagine it we can see that we really survive as\nspectators. Thus, the dictum could be dared in the psychoanalytic\nschool: at bottom, nobody believes in his own death. Or, and this is\nthe same: in his unconscious, every one of us is convinced of his\nimmortality.\n\n\n\nAll right, there's Freud. Basically, just running the argument I've\njust sketched for you. When you try to imagine your being dead, you\nsmuggle yourself back in as a spectator. And so, Freud concludes, at\nsome level none of us really believes we're going to die.\n\nI want to say, I think that argument's a horrible argument. How many\nof you believe that there are meetings that take place without you?\nSuppose you're a member of some club and there's a meeting this\nafternoon and you won't be there, because you've got to be someplace\nelse. So you ask yourself, \"Do I believe that meeting's going to take\nplace without me?\" At first glance, it looks like you do, but here's\nthe Freudian argument that shows you don't really. Try to imagine, try\nto picture that meeting without you. Well, when you do picture it,\nthere's that room in your mind's eye. You've got a little picture of\npeople sitting around the table perhaps, discussing the business of\nyour club. Uh-oh, I've smuggled myself in as a spectator. If, like\nyou--, I think most of us picture these things up from a perspective in\na corner of the room, up on the wall, looking down, kind of a fly's\nperspective. All right, I've smuggled myself in as a spectator. I'm\nactually in the room after all. So I haven't really pictured the\nmeeting taking place without me. So I guess I don't really believe the\nmeeting's going to take place without me.\n\nIf Freud's argument for death, that is to say, none of us believe\nwe're going to die, was any good, the argument that none of us believe\nmeetings ever take place without us would have to work as well. But\nthat's silly. It's clear that we all do believe in the possibility,\nindeed, more than a mere possibility, the actuality of meetings that\noccur without us. Even though when I imagine that meeting, I'm in some\nsense, smuggling myself in as an observer. From which I think it\nfollows that the mere fact that I've smuggled myself in as an observer\ndoesn't mean that I don't really believe in the possibility that I'm\nobserving in my mind's eye. I can believe in the existence of a meeting\nthat takes place, even though I smuggle myself in as an observer when I\npicture that meeting. I can believe in the possibility of a world\nwithout me, even though I smuggle myself in as an observer when I\npicture that world without me.\n\nFreud's mistake, and it's--although I'm picking on Freud, it's not\nonly Freud that runs this sort of argument. One comes across it\nperiodically. Within the last year, a member of our law school here put\nforward this very argument and said he thought it was a good one. So\npeople think the argument's a good one. It strikes me as it's got to be\na bad one. The confusion, the mistake I think people are making when\nthey make this argument, the mistake I think they're making is this.\nIt's one thing to ask yourself, what's the content of the picture? It's\nanother thing to ask, when you look at the picture, are you existing?\nAre you looking at the picture from a certain point of view?\n\nSuppose I hold up a photograph of a beach with nobody on it. All\nright, am I in that beach, as pictured in that photograph? Of course\nnot. But as I look at it, whether in reality or in my mind's eye, I'm\nlooking at it from a perspective. As I think about it, I'm viewing the\nbeach from a point of view which may well be on the beach, if somebody\ndraws a painting of a beach. But for all that, that doesn't mean that\nwithin the picture of the beach, I'm in the beach. Looking at a picture\ndoesn't mean you're in the picture. Viewing the meeting from a\npoint of view, doesn't mean you're in the meeting. Viewing the world\nwithout you from a point of view, doesn't mean you're in the world. So\nalthough of course it's true, when I imagine these various\npossibilities without me, I'm thinking about them. I'm observing them.\nAnd I'm observing them from a particular perspective, from a particular\nstandpoint. For all that, I'm not in the picture that I'm\nthinking about. So I think the Freudian argument just fails. Now, maybe\nthere's some other reason to believe the claim that nobody believes\nthey will cease to exist. But if there is another argument for that\nclaim, I'm eager to hear it, because this argument, at any rate, seems\nto me to be unsuccessful.\n\nNow, at the start, I distinguished two claims people might have in\nmind when they say, \"Nobody believes they're going to die.\" The first\npossibility was the claim was, nobody believes that they'll ever cease\nto exist as a person. And I've just explained why at least the most\nfamiliar argument for that claim, I think, doesn't work. The second\npossible interpretation was this. Nobody believes their body is going\nto die. That is, the more familiar humdrum event of death where your\nbody ceases functioning and you end up having a corpse that gets buried\nand so forth. Sometimes it's suggested that nobody believes that\neither. Of course, often, I think, people run together these two\nquestions. When they say you don't believe you're going to die, do you\nmean, you don't believe your body's going to die? or you don't believe\nyou're going to cease to exist as a person? Maybe when people make the\nclaim, it's not clear which of these things they've got in mind.\n\nBut let's, at least, try to now focus on the second question. Could\nit be true, is there any good reason to believe it is true, that nobody\nbelieves they're going to undergo bodily death? Now, after all, even if\nyou believe that, well, your soul will go to heaven so you won't cease\nto exist as a person, you might still believe that your body will die.\nMost of us presumably do believe our bodies will die. At least, that's\nhow it seems to me. So it's a bit odd to suggest, as it nonetheless\ndoes get suggested, that no, no, at some level, people don't really\nbelieve they're going to die.\n\nLet me point out just how odd a claim that is. Because people do all\nsorts of behaviors which become very, very hard to interpret if they\ndon't really believe their bodies are going to die. People, for\nexample, take out life insurance so that--well, here's what seems to be\nthe explanation. They believe that there's a decent chance that they\nwill die within a certain period of time. And so, if that happens, they\nwant their children and family members to be cared for. If you didn't\nreally believe you were going to die, that is undergo bodily death, why\nwould you take out life insurance? People write wills. \"Here's what you\nshould do with my estate after I die.\" If you didn't really believe\nthat your body was going to die, why would you ever bother writing a\nwill? Since many people write wills, many people take out life\ninsurance, it seems as though the natural thing to suggest is that\nmany, or at least perhaps most, at least many people believe they're\ngoing to die.\n\nWhy would we think otherwise? Well, the reason for thinking\notherwise, the reason for not being utterly dismissive of this\nsuggestion, is that when people get ill, terminally ill, it often seems\nto take them by surprise. So I've been having you read Tolstoy's\nnovella, The Death of Ivan Ilyich. Ivan Ilyich falls, he hurts\nhimself. The injury doesn't get better. He gets worse and worse and\neventually it kills him. The astonishing thing is that Ivan Ilyich is\nshocked to discover that he's mortal. And of course, what Tolstoy is\ntrying to convince us of, what he's trying to argue, by illustrating\nthe claim, I take it, that Tolstoy is making, is that most of us are\nactually in Ivan Ilyich's boat. We give lip service to the claim that\nwe're going to die, but at some level, we don't really believe it.\n\nAnd notice again, just to emphasize the point, the relevant lack of\nbelief here has to do with the death of the body. That's the thing that\nIvan Ilyich is skeptical about. Is his body going to die? Is he mortal\nin that sense? This is what takes him aback, to discover that he's\nmortal. For all we know, Ivan Ilyich still believes in souls, believes\nhe's going to go to heaven and so forth. So it's not his death as a\nperson that he's puzzled by. He may not think he's going to die as a\nperson. It's his bodily death that surprises him, his bodily mortality\nthat surprises him. Tolstoy draws a highly realistic and believable\nportrait of somebody who is surprised to discover that he's mortal. As\nhe puts it, there's a famous syllogism that people learn in their logic\nclasses from Aristotle. All men are mortal. Socrates is a man, so\nSocrates is mortal. Ivan Ilyich says, \"Yes, yes, I knew that. But what\ndid that have to do with me?\" Well, it may be a kind of irrationality.\nIt may be a kind of failure to conduct the logic. But we're not asking,\nis it rational or irrational to not believe that your body's going to\ndie, we're simply asking, noting the fact that, there to seem to be\ncases where people are surprised to discover that they're mortal.\n\nNow, for all that, notice, I presume that Ivan Ilyich had a will.\nAnd for all I know, Ivan Ilyich had life insurance. So we're in the\npeculiar situation where on the one hand, some of Ivan Ilyich's\nbehaviors indicate that he believed he was mortal, that his body was\ngoing to die. And yet, the shock and surprise that faces, that\novercomes him when he actually has to face his mortality, strongly\nsuggests that he's reporting correctly. He didn't believe he was going\nto die.\n\nHow could that be? There's a kind of puzzle there as to--even if,\nbefore we move to the question, how widespread are cases like this?\nthere's a puzzle as to how are we even to understand this case? We need\nto distinguish perhaps between what he consciously believes and what he\nunconsciously believes. Maybe at the conscious level he believed he was\nmortal, but at the unconscious level he believed he was immortal.\n\nOr maybe we need to distinguish between those things he gives a kind\nof lip service to, versus those things he truly and fundamentally\nbelieves. Maybe he gives lip service to the claim that he was mortal.\nIf you would have asked him \"Are you mortal?\" he would have said \"Oh,\nof course I am.\" And he buys life insurance accordingly. But does he\nthoroughly and truly and fundamentally believe he's mortal? Perhaps\nnot. We need some such distinction if we're going to make sense of Ivan\nIlyich.\n\nWell, let's suppose we've done it. Still have to ask, not, are there\nare ever cases of people who don't believe they're going to die? but\nrather, is there any good reason to think that we're all or most of us\nare in that situation, are in that state of belief where, although we\ngive lip service to the claim that we're going to die, is there any\ngood reason to believe that fundamentally we don't actually believe it?\nThat's the question we have to turn to next time.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct16.html":{"url":"lct16.html","title":"Lecture 16","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 16 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nMarch 8, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: --Tolstoy's Ivan Ilyich is surprised\nto discover that he's going to die. It's the sort of thing he's given\nlip service to, no doubt, over the course of his life. But when he\nfinally gets ill and comes up to the fact of his mortality, that his\nbody is going to sicken and eventually die, the fact of his mortality\nseems to shock him, seems to surprise him. We might say, on one level\nhe believes that he was mortal. He's believed it all along. But at\nanother level, at some deeper level, it comes as a surprise to him. He\nnever really believed it.\n\nNow, I take it that we find Ivan Ilyich a perfectly believable\nexample. That is, we think it's conceivable that somebody could, at\nsome level, not really believe they're going to die. But I also take it\nthat Tolstoy means to be putting forward more than just a claim that\nthere could be such a person. \"Look how bizarre he is. Let me\ndescribe him for you.\" But rather, the suggestion is meant to be that\nIvan Ilyich's case is rather typical. Maybe all of us are in his\nsituation, or at least most of us are in his situation. Or, at the very\nleast, many of us are in his situation. That's a stronger claim, though\nI think it's not the sort of claim that's unique to Tolstoy, that all\nof us or most of us or many of us at the fundamental level don't really\nbelieve that we're going to die.\n\nYou might ask, what kind of evidence could be offered for that?\nOffering a realistic scenario, a realistic description of such a\nperson--Ivan Ilyich--doesn't give us any reason to think that most of\nus or many of us are in his situation. So, is there any reason to think\nthat? You might ask, what kind of argument could be offered for a claim\nlike that?\n\nWhat we'd be looking for, I take it, would be some kind of behavior\non our part that calls out for explanation. And the best explanation is\nto be had--This is how the argument would go. The best explanation is\nto be had by supposing that those people who behave this way--Let's\nsuppose many of us who behave this way. The best explanation of that\nbehavior is to be found by claiming that at some level, at some\nfundamental level, we don't really believe what we claim to believe. We\ndon't really believe what we give lip service to.\n\nTake somebody who perhaps suffers from some sort of compulsion to\nwash his hands. We ask him, \"Are your hands dirty?\" He might say, \"No,\nof course not.\" And yet, there he is, going back to bathroom, washing\nhis hands again. You might say, the only way to explain the behavior is\nto say that at some level, he really does believe his hands are dirty,\ndespite the fact that he says they're not. Well, in the same way, if we\ncould find some behavior on our part that calls out for explanation,\nthat the best possible explanation would be that at some level we don't\nbelieve we're going to die, then we might say, look, this gives us some\nreason to think that we don't really believe we're going to die, even\nthough we say we believe it.\n\nSuppose, for example, that if you really did believe, fundamentally,\nunconsciously, all the way down--however we should put it--if you\nreally did believe you were going to die, the horror of that would lead\nyou to start screaming and just keep screaming. Of course, this example\nreminds us again of Ivan Ilyich, who screams and screams and screams\nalmost till his death. Well, suppose this was true. Suppose that if\nyou--Suppose we believed--we had good reason to believe--if you really\ntook seriously the thought that you were going to die, you couldn't\nstop screaming. But of course, nobody here is screaming, from which we\ncan conclude none of us really do believe, fundamentally, deep down,\nthat we're going to die. That would be a good argument if we had good\nreason to believe the conditional, the if-then claim. If only you\nreally truly believed you were going to die, you would scream and\nscream and scream. That's the crucial premise. And of course, we don't\nhave any good--as far as I can see--we don't have any good reason to\nbelieve that crucial premise.\n\nYou might ask though, is there some other behavior, something else\nthat should tip us off, could tip us off, as to whether or not we\nreally do or don't believe that we're going to die? Well, here's the\nbest that I can do. This strikes me as the most plausible contender for\nan argument like this. As we know, there are people who have brushes\nwith death. They might be, for example, in an accident, and come close\nto being killed, but walk away without a scratch. Or suffer a heart\nattack and be on the operating table for some number of hours and then,\nthanks to cardiac surgery or what have you, be resuscitated. When\npeople have these near brushes with death, it's easy to believe that\nthe fact of their mortality is more vivid. It's more before their\nmind's eye. It's something that they now really truly do believe. And\nthe interesting point is many people who have this sort of experience,\nfor whom their mortality has become vivid, they often say, \"I've got to\nchange my life. I need to spend less time at the office and more time\nwith my family, telling the people that I love that I love them, doing\nthe things that are important to me, spend less time worrying about\ngetting ahead, making money, getting the plasma TV,\" whatever it\nis.\n\nLet's suppose that this is true of all of us, or at least most of\nus. When we find the fact of our mortality is made vivid, when we\nreally truly can see that we're mortal, then we change our priorities,\nstop giving all the time and attention to trying to get ahead in the\nrat race and spend more time with our loved ones doing what's important\nto us. Suppose that claim were true. Well, armed with that claim, we\nmight notice, well look, of course, most of us do spend a lot of time\ntrying to get ahead, trying to earn a lot of money, don't spend the\nbulk of our time doing the things that we really truly think are most\nimportant to us, don't tell our friends, don't tell our family members\nhow much they mean to us, how much we love them. What are we to make of\nthat fact? Well, maybe the explanation is, although we give lip service\nto the claim that we're mortal, at some more fundamental level, we\ndon't truly believe it. The belief's not vivid for us. We don't believe\nit all the way down.\n\nWell, this is an argument--at least it seems to me--that has some\nchance of being right. I'm not at all convinced that it is right. But\nat least it doesn't seem to be the sort of argument, unlike some of the\narguments I've considered last time about oh, nobody believes they're\ngoing to die because you can't picture being dead or what have you.\nThis argument, I think, has some possibility of being right. It does\nseem as though people who have brushes with death change their behavior\nin significant ways. The fact that we don't behave in those other ways\ngives us some reason to believe that perhaps at some level we don't\ncompletely or fully or fundamentally believe we're going to die. As I\nsay, I'm not sure whether that argument's right. But at least it's an\nargument worth taking seriously.\n\nLet me turn now to a different claim that sometimes gets made about\ndeath. This is the claim--not that nobody believes they're going to\ndie; that's the one we've been talking about for the last lecture or\nso--but instead, the claim that everybody dies alone. This sounds like\none of those deep insights into the nature of death. It's got that kind\nof air of profundity about it that philosophy's thought to have or\naspires to have. Everyone dies alone. This is telling us something deep\nand important and interesting about the nature of death.\n\nNow, as it happens, this is one I'm going to be completely\ndismissive of. I think, as far as I can see, that the claim \"we all die\nalone,\" however we interpret it, just ends up being implausible or\nfalse. I give it such a hard time each time I teach this class, that\nI'm often tempted to just drop it from the discussion altogether. Even\nthough, if you've done the reading of the Edwards paper that I\nassigned, you have a series of quotes from Edwards in which people say\nthings like, they die alone. I sometimes come away after this\ndiscussion thinking, \"Why am I wasting our time? Nobody really believes\nthis, that we all die alone.\" Last year I was virtually ready to drop\nit and then, I kid you not, that very afternoon, I came across a quote.\nI'll share this with you in a second. Somebody saying, \"Oh, we all die\nalone.\" And then I think it was two days later, a week later, I came\nacross another quote of somebody saying, \"Oh, we all die alone.\" It\nmade me think, \"Oh, I guess this is a common enough thought.\"\n\nSo here are the two quotes. But I think once you start looking for\nthem, you find them everyplace. This first one is from the folk singer\nLoudon Wainwright III, from his song Last Man on Earth. \"We\nlearn to live together and then we die alone.\" We die alone.\nInteresting claim. It seems to say something important about the nature\nof death. Here's another quote. This is from the children's book,\nEldest by Christopher Paolini, the sequel, of course, to the\nbestseller Eragon. \"‚ÄòHow terrible,' said Eragon, ‚Äòto die alone,\nseparate, even from the one who is closest to you.'\" The answer given\nto Eragon, \"Everyone dies alone, Eragon, whether you are a king on a\nbattlefield or a lowly peasant lying in bed among your family, no one\ncan accompany you into the void‚Ä¶\" Everyone dies alone.\n\nAs I say, this is a common enough view. Two quotes. I could\ncertainly produce others. Everyone dies alone. The trick--The question\nwe're going to ask is, can we find some interpretation of that claim\nunder which, first of all it ends up being true, secondly, it ends up\nbeing a necessary truth about death? Suppose everyone happens to die on\nMonday, due to some cosmic coincidence. It might be sort of\ninteresting, but it wouldn't tell us something deep about the nature of\ndeath, if people could just as easily die on Tuesday. If it happened to\nbe that everybody dies in a room by themselves, that would be\ninteresting. We might wonder what causes it. But it wouldn't be some\ndeep insight into the nature of death. We're going to get a deep\ninsight if it's a necessary truth about death that everyone dies\nalone.\n\nSo it's got to be true. It's got to be a necessary truth. And, of\ncourse, it's got to be an interesting claim. If, when we interpret the\nclaim \"everyone dies alone,\" that just ends up being a slightly\npretentious way of saying everyone dies, we might say, oh yeah, that is\ntrue and it is a necessary truth, but it's not especially surprising.\nIt's not some deep surprising insight into the nature of death. We all\nknew everyone dies. You take that familiar fact and you wrap it up in\nthe language \"everyone dies alone.\" If that's all you're saying, you're\nnot saying anything interesting. When people say, \"You know, everyone\ndies alone,\" you're supposed to be gaining some deep insight into the\nnature of death.\n\nFinally, \"everyone dies alone\" is supposed to say something special\nabout death. It better not be that everyone does\neverything alone, because--in whatever the relevant sense of\nalone turns out to be--if everyone does everything alone, then\nof course that might be interesting. It might be very important and\ninsightful, but you're not saying anything especially interesting about\ndeath when you say everyone dies alone, if it's also true that everyone\neats their lunch alone.\n\nSo, all this is, is just, as we begin to ask ourselves, what could\nit possible mean when people say \"everyone dies alone\"? we're looking\nfor something that's true, necessary, interesting and, if not unique to\ndeath, at least not true of everything. I put these conditions down\nbecause, of course, what I want to suggest is although the sentence\n\"everyone dies alone,\" the claim that everyone dies alone, is one of\nthese things that people say, they're not really thinking very hard\nabout what they mean by it. Because once you actually push people, to\npin them down, what do you mean by it, you end up with something that's\neither just not true, or not interesting, or not necessary, or not\nparticularly unique to death.\n\nTake a possible interpretation. The most natural, straightforward,\nliteral, flat-footed interpretation. To say that somebody does\nsomething alone means they do it not in the presence of others.\nSomebody who lives by himself goes to sleep. If there's nobody else in\nthe bedroom, he's sleeping alone. On that straightforward\ninterpretation, to say that everybody dies alone, what we're saying is\nthat it's true of each one of us that he or she dies not in the\npresence of others. If that was true, it would be sort of surprising,\nstriking. We might wonder whether it's a necessary truth. But at least\nthere'd be something interesting there.\n\nBut of course, it's not true. We all know full well that sometimes\npeople die in the presence of others. We read earlier this semester\nPlato's Phaedo, which describes the death scene of Socrates.\nSocrates drinks the hemlock and dies in the presence of his friends and\ndisciples. Socrates does not die alone. And of course, we know that\nthere are many, many other cases in which people die in the presence of\ntheir friends, family, loved ones. It's just not true, given that\ninterpretation, to say we all die alone. So if that's what the claim\nmeans, it's false. Our challenge is to find some other interpretation\nof the claim.\n\nAll right, second possibility. When people say \"everyone dies\nalone,\" they don't mean to be saying you die, but not in the presence\nof others. They mean to be saying rather, even if there are others\naround you, even if there are others with you, dying is something that\nyou're doing alone. They aren't dying. Socrates' friends and disciples\nare not dying. He's the only one dying. And so everyone dies alone in\nthat sense. Well, that's an interesting claim, if it's true, but it's\nnot true. We could certainly have battlefields in which many people are\ndying along with others. There is Jones dying, but he's not dying\nalone. There's Smith dying at the same time right next to him. If\nthat's what people mean when they say \"everyone dies alone,\" then\nthat's clearly false as well. I presume that's not what people meant\neither. But then what was it that they did mean?\n\nWell, we could do better. We could say, look, when Socrates dies,\nhe's dying alone in the sense that he's doing it by himself. He's not\ndoing it in cooperation with anybody else, in coordination with anybody\nelse. On the battlefield, even if Smith and Jones are both dying, it's\nnot like this is some sort of cooperative, joint undertaking. You could\nbe walking down the sidewalk and Linda could be walking down the\nsidewalk and even though you're both walking down the sidewalk, you're\nnot walking down the sidewalk together. In contrast, you can\nwalk down the sidewalk with somebody. Say, \"Hey, let's go to the\nlibrary.\" And you walk down the sidewalk together. Walking is something\nyou can do with others, in the sense that it can be a joint activity, a\njoint undertaking.\n\nPerhaps the claim then is that dying is not something that can be\ndone in that way as a joint undertaking. Even if you're in a room or a\nbattlefield where people are dying at the same time as you, to your\nleft and your right, dying is not and cannot be something that is a\njoint undertaking.\n\nWell, that might be a proposal about what people mean when they say\n\"everybody dies alone.\" And if it is, all I can say is, again, it just\nseems to be false.\n\nNow admittedly, dying as a joint undertaking is far rarer than dying\nalone. But for all that, we were looking for some deep insight into the\nnature of death. Everyone dies alone. Everyone must die alone. That's\nonly going to be true if dying as a joint undertaking is impossible.\nBut it's not impossible. You could have, for example, some sort of\nsuicide pact. There have been cases, gruesome as they may be, in which\nentire groups of people drink poison together so as to die not alone,\nbut die together, die as part of jointly dying, dying as a group. Or\nyou could have, once told that this sort of thing happens, a couple in\nlove who together jump off the cliff, committing suicide together,\ndying not alone but with each other as part of a joint undertaking. It\ncertainly seems possible. I take it cases like this actually do occur.\nSo if somebody comes along and says \"No, no, everybody dies alone, and\ndying as part of a joint undertaking is impossible,\" they're just\nsaying something false.\n\nThese joint undertakings are like, well, you might think of them\nanalogous to playing chamber music with a string quartet. It's\nsomething you're doing with others. It's not just a coincidence that\nthey're doing it at the same time. All these people happen to be\nplaying the violin, viola, or what have you next to you. No, no, we\ndeliberately coordinated with one another so as to together produce\nthis music. It seems possible in the case of string quartets. It seems\npossible in the case of joint suicide pacts as well.\n\nWell, a fan of the claim that we all die alone might come back and\nsay, \"Well, in the case of the string quartet, although it's true that\nI am playing with others, somebody could take my part. Somebody else\ncould play the second violin part for me. Whereas, in contrast, when I\ndie, even if I'm dying with others, nobody can take my part.\" So\nperhaps that's what the claim is meant to be when people say,\n\"everybody dies alone.\" Nobody can die your death for you. Nobody can\ntake your part. Now if that's what they mean, then--a small\nobservation--they didn't express themselves very clearly. It seems to\nme rather a long distance from the thought, \"nobody can die for me,\nnobody can take my part,\" to the claim, \"everybody dies alone.\" That\nseems a rather misleading, unhelpful, way of making your point. But\nlet's just bracket that complaint.\n\nIt is true that nobody can take my part? Certainly people can take\nmy part in the string quartet. Is it true that nobody can take my part\nin terms of my death? Not so clear it is true. I don't know how many of\nyou have read Tale of Two Cities. If not, I'm about to spoil the\nplot for you. Here's at least a strand of the story. The hero of the\nstory is in love with a woman who--alas and alack--does not love him.\nShe loves another man. This other man--alas and alack--has been\ncondemned to death during the French Revolution. Now as it\nhappens--this is a novel--as it happens, our hero looks rather like the\nother man. And so as the other man is being carted off to the\nguillotine to be killed, our hero takes his place. Hence, the famous\nspeech, \"Tis a far, far better thing I do today.\" Our hero sacrifices\nhimself so that the woman he loves can have the man that she loves.\nWell, for our purposes, the romance isn't crucial. For our purposes,\nthe crucial point is to see that what seems to be going on there is our\nhero is taking the place of somebody else who's about to die. Just like\nsomebody could take my place in the string quartet, it seems that\nsomebody could take my place at the guillotine.\n\nIn the American Civil War, there was a draft, but you could avoid it\nby hiring somebody to take your place, if you were rich enough. Well,\nyou're in some battle, or rather, your troop is in some battle, and\npeople are being killed left and right. Well, I suppose it doesn't\nstrike me as an implausible thing to say that if everybody in the troop\ngot killed and you would have gotten killed had you been there, but\ninstead, the person you hired to take your place gets killed, then he\ntook your place. He substituted for you in the death. So again, we\ndon't have any clear, true interpretation of the claim that nobody can\ntake my place, even with regard to dying.\n\nWell, easy to imagine the fan of this view coming back yet again and\nsaying, \"Although it's true that our hero takes the place of the other\nman on the guillotine, what ends up happening, of course, is that our\nhero dies his own death. He doesn't take over the death of the other\nman. The death of the other man doesn't take place until 20, 30, 40,\nwhatever it is, years later. Nobody can take my place at my\ndeath. Because, of course, if they take my place, they end up living or\ngoing through, rather, their death not my death. My death\nis something that only I can undergo. Now again, that's an\ninteresting claim if it's true. At least it seems to be an interesting\nclaim. It seems to say something interesting about death.\n\nAgain, I want to just notice that it's a rather odd thing to try to\nexpress that point in the language \"everyone dies alone.\" But just\nbracket that. Have we at least found something interesting, necessary,\nunique to death when we say, \"Nobody can die my death for me. I am the\nonly one who can undergo my death\"? Each of us must undergo his own\ndeath and nobody else's death. Nobody else can undergo their death for\nthem, somebody else's death for them. Well, that does seem to be true\nand it seems to be a necessary truth. But we're not quite done. Is it\nsaying something deep and interesting about the nature of death? Is it\nsomething that's fairly unique to the nature of death? That nobody can\ndie my death for me. Actually, I don't think it is.\n\nConsider getting your hair cut at the barber. Now of course,\nsomebody else can take your slot. All right, there's somebody who comes\nalong and says, \"Oh, I need to get to a date. I'm going to be late.\nWould you mind my having your appointment, using your appointment?\"\n\"Oh, I'm willing to wait. It's okay,\" right? So you might say, in some\nloose sense they've gotten your haircut. But of course, as it ended up,\nthey didn't really get your haircut. They got their\nhaircut. Think about haircuts. Nobody can get my haircut for me.\nI'm the only one who can get my haircut. If somebody else tries\nto get my haircut, they just end up getting their own\nhaircut.\n\nOf course, it's not just special about haircuts. Talk about getting\nyour kidney stones removed. Nobody else can get my kidney stones\nremoved for me. I'm the only one who can get my kidney stones removed\nfor me. Think about eating lunch. Nobody can eat my lunch for\nme. If somebody else tries to eat my lunch, they end up--it becomes\ntheir lunch. They've eaten their lunch for themselves. Nobody\ncan eat my lunch for me except for me. If you think about it, it's true\nabout just about everything. Maybe indeed everything. If you emphasize\nthe word \"my\" enough, nobody can do much of anything for me and still\nhave it be my such and such. In short, even though it's true\nthat nobody can die my death for me, this isn't some deep insight into\nthe special nature of death. It's just a trivial grammatical point\nabout the meaning of the word \"my.\"\n\nAll right, remember where we're at. We're looking for\ninterpretations of the claim \"everyone dies alone.\" And by now we've\ngone rather far afield in the search for an interpretation of that\nclaim. But we have not yet been able to find a claim, an\ninterpretation, which is true, interesting, fairly special about death,\nas opposed to trivially true about everything, and giving us some\nrelatively interesting insight into the nature of death. I can't see it\nfor the claim \"everyone dies alone.\" At least not if we try to take\nthese claims fairly literally or take them to be metaphysical claims\nabout the nature of death.\n\nBut maybe I've just been flatfooted here in thinking that this is\nsome sort of claim about not being with others, or things I do by\nmyself. Maybe the claim \"we all die alone\" is intended as a kind of\nmetaphor. It's not that we all really do die alone. It's that when we\ndie, it's as though we were alone. It's like being alone.\nMaybe the claim \"we all die alone\" is a psychological claim, that the\npsychological state we are in when we die is similar to loneliness.\nIt's similar to the feeling of being alone that we have in various\nsituations.\n\nNow, that would be interesting if it was true. Is it true that when\nwe die we all die having this feeling of loneliness, or perhaps feeling\nof alienation? It's easy enough to imagine somebody who is surrounded\nby other people as he's dying. And yet, for all that, feels removed,\ndistant, alienated from the others, feels lonely even in the crowd. Is\nthat true of all of us?\n\nRemember, we're looking for a claim that says, that makes it true,\nthat everyone dies alone. Is it true that everyone dies feeling distant\nand removed? Maybe it was true of Ivan Ilyich. Ivan Ilyich\nprogressively grows more and more distant from his family and friends\nwho, indeed, remove themselves psychologically from him. He faces his\ndeath with a feeling of alienation and being alone. It's a metaphor,\nbut still an important insight into his psychology. The question we\nhave to ask is, \"Is that true of everybody? Is it true that everybody\ndies alone in this psychological sense?\" It doesn't seem to be\ntrue.\n\nFirst of all, notice the obvious point that sometimes people die in\ntheir sleep, unexpectedly. They weren't ill. They just die of cardiac\narrest while they're sleeping. Such a person presumably is not feeling\nlonely or alienated while he dies. Well, you might say, \"Okay, what we\nmeant was anybody who's awake while they're dying, dies alone.\"\nThat's not true either. You're crossing the street, talking to your\nfriend, engaged in lively discussion. So lively, you don't notice the\ntruck that's about to hit you. The truck hits you, you die, painlessly\nand immediately. Well, were you feeling alienated and distant during\nyour final moments? No, it doesn't seem right either. So it certainly\ndoesn't seem true to say that everybody dies feeling these\npsychological feelings of loneliness.\n\nWell, maybe what we should have to do is revise the claim yet again.\nEverybody who dies awake, realizing that they're dying, facing the fact\nthat they're dying, they all, we all of whom that's true, we all die\nalone, as long as we realize we're dying. That would take care of the\nsleep case. That would take care of the truck case. Is the claim true\nthen? It would still be interesting if it was true, even given those\nrestrictions. But it doesn't seem true then either. Again, just recall\nSocrates. Socrates is engaged in philosophical discussion with his\nfriends, knows he's about to die. He's drunk the hemlock. He's sitting\nthere saying goodbye to everybody. He doesn't seem alienated. He\ndoesn't seem to be feeling distant and alone. It just doesn't seem true\nthat everybody who knows they're going to die and is facing their death\nfeels lonely.\n\nAnother example of this is another philosopher, David Hume, whom\nwe'll be reading at the end of the semester. We'll be reading his essay\non suicide. Hume died, had an illness. He was quite sociable to the\nend. He used to bring people in to sit around his deathbed talking\nabout various matters with him. He was cheerful and pleasant to the\nend. And there's, as far as I can see, no reason at all to believe that\nhe was feeling lonely, feeling distant, feeling alienated from the\npeople who were keeping him company. So the psychological reading\ndoesn't do any better, as far as I can see.\n\nWell, maybe there's some other interpretation, and I invite you to\nreflect on the question. Is it true that we all die alone? Is there\nsome way of understanding that claim where it's true, a necessary\ntruth, fairly special and unique, if not altogether unique, at least\nfairly special about death, showing us some deep insight into the\nnature of death--as opposed to some trivial insight about the way the\npossessive first person pronoun \"my\" works? I can't find it. So despite\nthe fact that the claim \"we all die alone\" is one of these things that\none hears, I think it's just nonsense. I think it's people talking\nwithout giving a moment's thought to what they meant when they said\nit.\n\nAll right, where are we? For the first half of the course, we've\nbeen engaged in metaphysics, broadly speaking. We've been trying to get\nclear about the nature of the person, what we're composed of, so that\nwe could then try to get clearer about the nature of survival and\nidentity of persons, so that we could think about the nature of death,\nmetaphysically speaking. What happens when we die? And as you know,\nI've defended the physicalist conception, according to which all we are\nare just bodies capable of doing some fancy tricks, capable of\nP-functioning. And details aside, death is a matter of the body\nbreaking, so that it's no longer able to engage in\nP-functioning. As we saw, depending on the particular details of\nwhich theory of personal identity you accept--the body view, the brain\nview, the personality theory of personal identity--we might have to say\nslightly different things about whether the death of my body means I no\nlonger exist, whether we should distinguish the death of the body, the\ndeath of the person, and so forth.\n\nBut those details aside, roughly speaking, the following is true.\nWhen the body breaks, I cease to exist as a person. And even if we can\nhold out the logical possibility of my being resurrected--or my\ncontinuing to exist with a different body as long as it's got my\npersonality, if you happen to accept the personality theory--even\nthough there is the logical possibility of surviving my death or coming\nback to life, I see no good reason to believe that those logical\npossibilities are actual. As far as I can see, when my body dies,\nthat's it. As a fan of the body view, I believe I'll still exist for a\nwhile. I'll exist as a corpse. But that's not the kind of thing about\nexistence that mattered to me. In terms of what mattered to me, what I\nwanted was not just that I exist, but that I be alive, indeed be a\nperson, indeed be a person with pretty much the same personality. And\nthe truth of the matter is, when my body dies, that's all history.\nThat's where we're at in terms of the metaphysics.\n\nWe could summarize this by saying, when I die, I cease to exist.\nThat's a little bit misleading, given the view I just sketched where\neven though I'm dead I still exist for a while as a corpse. But those\nissues won't concern us in what we're about to turn to. Let's just\nsuppose that, for the sake of avoiding those complications, that when\nmy body dies, it gets destroyed. And so the very same moment will be\nthe end of my body, the end of my existence, the end of my personhood.\nLet's suppose that my personality doesn't get destroyed any sooner than\nthe death of my body. We've got the end of my existence. Here I am\ngoing along. The atomizer comes along, blows me up. Then\nsimultaneously, we've got the death of my person, the death of my body,\nthe end of what matters to me, the end of my existence. Death is the\nend. And even though these things can come across--can come apart\nslightly under certain scenarios, those details won't matter for what\nwe're about to turn to.\n\nWell, what are we about to turn to? We're about to turn to value\ntheory. We spent the first half of the semester, you might say, trying\nto get clear about the metaphysical facts. And now that we've done that\nas best we can, we want to turn to the ethical or value questions. How\ngood or bad is death? Why is--I take it, we all believe death is bad.\nWhy is death bad? How can death be bad? So this is the\nbig continental divide for the course. The first half of the class was\nmetaphysics. Now we turn to value questions.\n\nAnd the first question we're going to be focusing on is just this,\nthe question of the badness of death. How and in what ways is\ndeath bad? I take it, most of us do believe that death is bad. That's\nwhy we wish--maybe some of us believe, but at the very least the rest\nof us, many of us hoped--there were souls, so that death wouldn't have\nto be the end. If death is the end, that seems to be horrible. So we're\ngoing to turn to questions like this. How and in what ways is death\nbad? And then we're going to turn to the question, is it really true\nthat immortality would be good? And eventually, we'll turn to some\nother value questions about if death really is the end, should we be\nafraid of death? I take it that fear of death is quite common. But we\ncan actually evaluate different emotions and think about whether these\nemotional responses are appropriate or not, so we can ask whether or\nnot fear of death is appropriate. We'll turn eventually to the\nquestion, how should we live in light of the fact that death is the\nend? And the last question we'll turn to is, could it ever make sense\nto kill ourselves? So these are the kind of moral or value questions\nwe'll be concerned with until the end of the term. But the first one is\nsimply, is death bad, as we typically take it to be, and, if so, what\nis it about it that makes it bad?\n\nSo again, I'm going to suppose here on out that the metaphysical\nview that I've been sketching is right; that physicalism is true. The\ndeath of my body is the end of my existence as a person. Death is my\nend. Well, if that's right, how can it be bad for me to die? After all,\nonce I'm dead, I don't exist. If I don't exist, how can it be bad for\nme that I'm dead?\n\nIt's easy to see how you might think, how you might worry about the\nbadness of death, if you thought you would survive your death.\nNow, if you believed in a soul, then you might worry about, well, gosh\nwhat's going to happen to my soul after I die? Am I going to make it up\nto heaven? Am I going to go to hell? You might worry about how badly\noff you're going to be once you're dead. The question makes perfect\nsense. But it's often seemed to people that if we really believe that\ndeath is the end--and that's the assumption that I'm making here on\nout--if we really believe death is the end, how can death be bad for\nme? How could anything be bad for me once I'm dead? If I don't exist,\nit can't be bad for me.\n\nWell, sometimes in response to this thought, people respond by\nsaying, \"Look, death isn't bad for the person who's dead. Death is bad\nfor the survivors.\" John's death isn't bad for John. John's death is\nbad for the people who loved John and now have to continue living\nwithout John. John's death is bad for John's friends and family. When\nsomebody dies, we lose the chance to continue interacting with the\nperson. We're no longer able to talk with them, spend time with them,\nwatch a movie, look at the sunset, have a laugh. We're no longer able\nto tell our troubles with them and get their advice. We're no longer\nable to interact with them. All that's gone, when somebody dies.\n\nAnd the claim might be, that's the central bad of death. Not what it\ndoes for the person who dies. It's not bad for the person who dies.\nIt's what it does for the rest of them, the rest of us.\n\nNow, I don't in any way want to belittle the importance of the pain\nand suffering that happen for the rest of us when somebody that we care\nabout dies. Indeed, let me take a moment and read a poem that\nemphasizes this thought, because this is certainly one central, very\nbad thing about death. It robs us of our friends--we, the survivors--it\nrobs us of our friends and loved ones. Poem. The poem is called\nSeparation, by the German poet, Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock.\nThis is in one of the essays you'll be reading later in the semester by\nWalter Kaufmann--he quotes it--Death Without Dread. The poem, as\nI say, is Separation.\n\nYou turned so serious when the corpse\n was carried past us;\n are you afraid of death? \"Oh, not of that!\"\nOf what are you afraid? \"Of dying.\"\n\nI not even of that. \"Then you're afraid of nothing?\"\nAlas, I am afraid, afraid‚Ä¶\"Heavens, of what?\"\n Of parting from my friends.\n And not mine only, of their parting, too.\n\nThat's why I turned more serious even\n than you did, deeper in the soul,\n when the corpse\n was carried past us [Kaufmann 1976]\n\n\n\nThe poem is called Separation. According to Klopstock, the\ncrucial badness of death is losing your friends. When they die, you\nlose them. And as I say, I don't in any way want to belittle the\ncentral badness of that. But I don't think it can be at the core in\nterms of what's bad about death. I don't think that can be the central\nfact about why death is bad. And to see this, let me tell you two\nstories. Compare them.\n\nStory number one. Your friend is about to go on the spaceship which\nis going to do the exploration of Jupiter or whatever. And they're\ngoing to be gone for years, years and years. It takes so long that by\nthe time the spaceship comes back, 100 years will have gone by. Maybe\nit's not Jupiter. It's farther away. Worse still, after about 20\nminutes after the ship takes off, all radio contact between ship and\nearth will be destroyed. It won't be possible, because of the speed.\nIt's not going to Jupiter. It's going to some other planetary system.\nSo, all possibility of communication will be destroyed. Now, this is\nhorrible. You're losing your closest friend. You will no longer be able\nto talk to them, share the moments, get their insights and advice.\nYou'll no longer be able to tell them about the things that have been\ngoing on. It's the same kind of separation that Klopstock was talking\nabout. Horrible, and it's sad. That was story number one.\n\nStory number two, just like story number one, the spaceship takes\noff, and about 15 minutes later, it explodes in a horrible accident and\neverybody on the spaceship, including your friend, is killed. Now, I\ntake it that story number two is worse. Something worse has taken\nplace. Well, what's the worse thing? We've got of course the very same\nseparation we had in story number one. I can't communicate in the\nfuture with my friend. They can't communicate with me. But we had that\nalready in story number one. If there's something worse about story\nnumber two, and I think it's pretty clear there is something worse,\nit's not the separation. It's something about the fact that your friend\nhas died. Now of course, this is worse for me, as somebody who cares\nabout my friend, that he's died. But the explanation of what's bad for\nme, in his having died, is the fact that it's bad for him to\nhave died. And the badness for him isn't just a matter of separation,\nbecause that we already had in number one. We couldn't communicate with\nhim. He couldn't communicate with us.\n\nIf we want to get at the central badness of death, it seems to me,\nwe can't focus on the badness of separation, the badness for the\nsurvivors. We have to think about how is it, how could it be true, that\ndeath is bad for the person that dies? That's the central\nbadness of death and that's the one I'm going to have us focus on. How\ncould it be true that death is bad for the person that dies? That's the\nquestion we turn to next time.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n---\n\nCredits:\n\n\"Separation\" by Friedrich Klopstock, translated by Walter Kaufmann,\nfrom EXISTENTIALISM, RELIGION AND DEATH by Walter Kaufmann, copyright ¬©\n1976 by Walter Kaufmann.

We started asking about what it is about\ndeath that makes it bad. The first aspect of the badness of death that\nwe talked about was the fact that when somebody dies, that's hard on\nthe rest of us. We're left behind having to cope with the loss of this\nperson that we love. Nonetheless, it seems likely that if we want to\nget clear about the central badness of death, it can't be a matter of\nthe loss for those who remain behind, but rather the loss, the badness\nof death, for the person who dies. That, at any rate, is what I want to\nfocus on from here on out. What exactly is it about my death, or the\nfact that I'm going to die, that makes that bad for me?\n\nNow, I want to get clear about precisely what it is we want to focus\nin on here. Now, one thing that could be bad, obviously, is the process\nof dying could be a painful one. It might be, for example, that I get\nripped to pieces by Bengali tigers. And if so, then the actual process\nof dying would be horrible. It would be painful. And clearly it makes\nsense to talk about the process of dying as something that could\npotentially be bad for me. Although similarly, I might die in my sleep,\nin which case the process of dying would not be bad for me. At any\nrate, I take it that most of us, although we might have some passing\nconcern about the possibility that our process of dying might be a\npainful one, that's not, again, the central thing we're concerned about\nwhen we face the fact that we're going to die.\n\nIt's also true, of course, that many of us find--;here, right now,\nwhile we're not actually dying--the prospect of dying to be\nunpleasant. So, one of the things that's bad about my death for me is\nthat right now I've got some unhappy thoughts as I anticipate the fact\nthat I'm going to die. But again, that can't be the central thing\nthat's bad about death, because the prospect of my death--it makes\nsense for that to be a painful one or an unpleasant one, only given the\nfurther claim that death itself is bad for me. Having fear or anxiety\nor concern or regret or anguish or whatever it is that maybe I have now\nabout the fact that I'm going to die, piggybacks on the logically prior\nthought that death itself is bad for me. If it didn't piggyback in that\nway, it wouldn't make any sense to have fear or anxiety or dread or\nanguish or whatever it is that I may have now.\n\nI mean, suppose I said to you, \"Tomorrow something's going to happen\nto you and that thing is going to be simply fantastic, absolutely\nincredible, absolutely wonderful.\" And you said, \"Well, I believe you\nand I have to tell you, I'm just filled with dread and foreboding in\nthinking about it.\" That wouldn't make any sense at all. It makes sense\nto be filled with dread or foreboding or what have you only if the\nthing you're looking forward to, anticipating, is itself bad. Maybe,\nfor example, it makes sense to dread going to the dentist, if you\nbelieve that being at the dentist is a painful, unpleasant experience.\nBut if being at the dentist isn't itself unpleasant, it doesn't make\nsense to dread it in anticipation.\n\nSo again, if we're thinking about the central badness of death, it\nseems to me that we've got to focus on my being dead. What is it\nabout my being dead that's bad for me? Now, if we pose that\nquestion, it seems as though the answer should be simple and\nstraightforward. When I'm dead, I won't exist. Now previously, in the\nfirst part of the class, we spent some time saying that, look, on\ncertain views, there'll be a period of time in which you might be dead,\nbut your body might still be alive. Or you might be dead, but even\nthough your body still exists, it's not alive, but you exist as a\ncorpse. Put all that aside. Go to the period beyond any of that murky\nstuff in the short-term and just, for simplicity, let's suppose with\nthe physicalists that once I die, I cease to exist. All right.\n\nSo, don't we have the answer to what's bad about death right there?\nWhen I'm dead, I won't exist. Isn't that the straightforward\nexplanation about why death is bad? Now, what I want to say, in effect,\nis this. I do think the fact that I won't exist does provide the key to\ngetting clear about how and why death is bad. But I don't think it's\nquite straightforward. I think, as we'll see, it actually takes some\nwork to spell out exactly how death, how nonexistence, could be bad for\nme. And even having done that, there'll be some puzzles that remain\nthat we'll be turning to in a little while.\n\nSo, the basic idea seems to be straightforward enough. When I'm\ndead, I won't exist. Isn't it clear that nonexistence is bad for me?\nWell, immediately you get an objection. You say, how could\nnonexistence be bad for me? After all, the whole point of nonexistence\nis you don't exist. How could anything be bad for you when you don't\nexist? Isn't there a kind of logical requirement that for something to\nbe bad for you, you've got to be around to receive that bad thing? A\nheadache, for example, can be bad for you. But of course, you exist\nduring the headache. Headaches couldn't be bad for people who don't\nexist. They can't experience or have or receive headaches. How could\nanything be bad for you when you don't exist? And in particular,\nthen, how could nonexistence be bad for you when you don't exist?\n\nSo it's not, as I say, altogether straightforward to see how the\nanswer \"Death is bad for me, because when I'm dead I don't exist,\" how\nthat answers the problem, as opposed to simply focusing our\nattention on the problem. How can nonexistence be bad for me? The\nanswer to this objection, I think, is to be found in drawing a\ndistinction between two different ways in which something can be bad\nfor me.\n\nOn the one hand, something can be bad for me, we might say, in an\nabsolute, robust, intrinsic sense. Take a headache, again, or some\nother kind of pain--stubbing your toe or getting stabbed or whatever it\nis, being tortured. Pain is intrinsically bad. It's bad in its\nown right. It's something we want to avoid for its own sake. And\nthose--;Normally, things that are bad for you are bad intrinsically.\nThey're bad by virtue of their very nature. There's something about the\nway they are that you don't want those that are bad in their own\nright.\n\nBut there's another way of something being bad for you that it's\neasy to overlook. Something can be bad comparatively. Something\ncould be bad because of what you're not getting while you get this bad\nthing. It could be what the economists call bad by virtue of \"the\nopportunity costs.\" It's not that it's intrinsically bad; it's bad\nbecause while you're doing this, you're not getting something\nbetter.\n\nHow could that be? Let's have a simple example. Suppose that I stay\nhome and watch something on TV--Deal or No Deal. I watch this on\nTV and I have a good enough time. How could that be bad for me? Well,\nin terms of the first notion of bad, something being intrinsically bad,\nit's not bad. It's a pleasant enough way to spend a half an hour, or\nhowever long the show is on. On the other hand, suppose what I could be\ndoing instead of watching a half an hour of television is being at a\nreally great party. Then we might say, the fact that I'm stuck home\nwatching television is bad for me in this comparative sense.\nIt's not that it's, in itself, an unpleasant way to spend some time;\nit's just that there's a better way to spend time that I could be\ndoing, in principle at least. If only I'd gone. If only I'd been\ninvited. If only I remembered, what have you. And because I'm foregoing\nthat better good, there's something bad, comparatively speaking, about\nthe fact that I'm stuck at home watching TV. There's a lack of the\nbetter good. A lack is not intrinsically bad, but it's still a\nkind of bad in this second sense. To be lacking a good is, itself, bad\nfor me.\n\nSimilarly, suppose I hold out two envelopes and I say, \"Pick one.\"\nAnd you open up the first one, you pick the first one, and you open it\nup and you say, \"Hey look, ten bucks! Isn't that good for me?\" Well, of\ncourse, ten bucks is intrinsically good. Anyway, well, it's not\nintrinsically good, it's only good as a means to buy something. But\nit's sort of good. It's worth having for its own right, because of what\nit can get you. But if unbeknownst to you, the other envelope had\n$1,000 in it, then we can say, \"Look, it's bad for you that you picked\nthe first envelope.\" Bad in what sense? Because you would have been\nbetter off, had you picked the second envelope. You would have been\nhaving more good, or a greater amount of good.\n\nWell, nonexistence can't be bad for me in our first sense. It can't\nbe that nonexistence is intrinsically bad, worth avoiding for its own\nsake. That would only make sense if nonexistence was somehow, for\nexample, painful. But when you don't exist, you have no painful\nexperiences. There's nothing about nonexistence in and of itself that\nmakes us want to avoid it. Nonexistence is only bad for me in this\ncomparative sense, because of the lack. When I don't exist, I'm lacking\nstuff.\n\nWhat am I lacking? Well, of course, what I'm lacking is life\nand more particularly still, the good things that life can give\nme. So, nonexistence is bad by virtue of the opportunity costs that are\ninvolved. Famously, W.C. Fields on his tombstone says, \"Personally, I'd\nrather be in Philadelphia.\" What's bad about being dead is you don't\nget to experience and enjoy any longer the various good things that\nlife would offer us. So nonexistence does point to the key aspect about\ndeath. Why is death bad? Because when I'm dead I don't exist. But if we\nask, why is and how can it be the case that nonexistence is bad? the\nanswer is, because of the lack of the good things in life. Because when\nI don't exist, I am not getting the things that I could have otherwise\ngotten, if only I were still alive. Death is bad because it deprives me\nof the good things in life.\n\nThis account is nowadays known as the deprivation account of\nthe evil or badness of death, for obvious reasons, right? The key\nthought is, the central bad about death, about nonexistence, is that it\ndeprives you of the goods of life you might otherwise be\ngetting. That's the deprivation account. And it seems to me that the\ndeprivation account basically has it right. Eventually, I'll go on to\nargue that there are other aspects of death that may also contribute to\nits badness, aspects above and beyond the one that gets focused on by\nthe deprivation account. But still, it seems to me the deprivation\naccount points us correctly to the central thing about death that's\nbad. What's most importantly bad about the fact that I'll be dead is\nthe fact that when I'm dead, I won't be getting the good things in\nlife. I'll be deprived of them. That's the badness of death according\nto the deprivation account.\n\nNow, if we accept the deprivation account, if we try to accept the\ndeprivation account, we face some further philosophical puzzles.\nPuzzles that many people have thought are sufficiently overwhelming\nthat we, despite the initial plausibility of the deprivation account,\nhave to give it up. First objection is this. Look, if something is\ntrue--a quite general point, it seems, about metaphysics--if something\nis true, there's got to be a time when it's true. If I make some\nclaim about a fact, there's got to be a time when that fact is true.\nHere's a fact. Shelly's lecturing to you now about the badness of\ndeath. When is that fact true? When was that fact true? Well, right\nnow. Here's another fact. Shelly once lectured to you about the nature\nof personal identity. When was that fact true? Well, we can point to a\nperiod of perhaps a week or two last month when I was lecturing to you\nabout personal identity. Things that are facts can be dated.\n\nAll right. That seems right. But if it is right, then immediately\nwe've got a puzzle. How could death be bad for me? If death was bad for\nme, that would be a fact. If my death is bad for me, that would be a\nfact and we'd ask, well, when is that fact true? We might say, well,\nit's not true now. Death isn't bad for me now. I'm not dead now. Maybe\ndeath is bad for me when I'm dead? But that seems very hard to believe.\nI mean, when I'm dead, I don't exist, right? How could anything be bad\nfor me then? Surely you've got to exist. So, there's a puzzle about\ndating the badness of death.\n\nNow, it may be that this puzzle about time and the date of the\nbadness of death is what Epicurus had in mind. There's a passage that\nI'm going to read to you in a moment from Epicurus. This passage has\npuzzled people, it has puzzled philosophers ever since. Epicurus seems\nto be putting his finger on something puzzling about death, though it's\ndifficult to pin down exactly what it is that's bugging him. So we're\ngoing to try an interpretation or two. But first, here's the passage\nfrom Epicurus. \"So death, the most terrifying of ills, is nothing to\nus, since so long as we exist, death is not with us; but when death\ncomes, then we do not exist. It does not then concern either the living\nor the dead, since for the former it is not, and the latter are no\nmore.\"\n\nYou see, it's not altogether clear what Epicurus is bothered by\nthere, but one possible interpretation is this puzzle about the timing\nof the badness of death. Death can't be bad for me now, because I'm\nalive. Death can't be bad for me when I'm dead. I am no more; then how\ncan things be bad for me then? But if death has no time at which it's\nbad for me, and if anything that's true, any fact has to have a time\nwhen it's true, then the purported fact that death is bad for me can't\nreally be a fact. All right.\n\nHow could we respond to this objection? Well, one way of course is\nto accept the objection and say, \"You're right. Death isn't really bad\nfor me.\" And some philosophers have indeed accepted that very\nconclusion, maybe Epicurus. Most of us want to say, \"No, no. Death is\nbad for me.\" So we need a better answer to the, \"Oh yeah? When is it\nbad for you?\" objection. Two possible responses. One possible response\nwould be to grab the bull by the horns and say, \"Death is bad for me.\nFacts do have to be dated. Let me tell you when it's bad for me.\" The\nother possible response is to grab, as it were, the other horn and say,\n\"You know, death is bad for me and I agree that I can't date it, but\nyou're wrong to assume that all facts have to be datable. There are\nsome things that are true that we can't put a date on.\"\n\nLet's start with the second. Could there be some things that are\ntrue that we can't put a date on? Well, here's one I think, maybe.\nSuppose that on Monday I shoot John. I wound him with the bullet that\ncomes out of my gun. But it's not a wound directly into his heart. He\nsimply starts bleeding. And he bleeds slowly. So he doesn't die on\nMonday. He's wounded and he's dying, but he doesn't die on Monday. On\nTuesday, let's suppose that I have a heart attack and I die. John's\nstill around--bleeding, but still around. On Wednesday, the loss of\nblood finally overtakes him and John dies. All right? So, I shoot him\non Monday, I die on Tuesday, John dies on Wednesday.\n\nNow, I killed John. I take it we're all in agreement about that. If\nI hadn't shot him, he wouldn't be dead. I killed him. When did I kill\nhim? Did I kill him on Monday, the day I shot him? That doesn't seem\nright. He's not dead on Monday. How could I kill him on Monday? Oh, he\ndied on Wednesday. Did I kill him on Wednesday? Well, how could that\nbe? I don't even exist on Wednesday. I died myself on Tuesday. How can\nI kill him after I'm dead? So I didn't kill him on Monday, didn't kill\nhim--rather on Wednesday. I didn't kill him on Monday, didn't kill him\non Wednesday when he dies. When did I kill him?\n\nWell, maybe the answer is there's no particular time at all when I\nkilled him. But for all that, it's true that I killed him. What makes\nit true that I killed him? What makes it true that I killed him is that\non Monday I shot him and on Wednesday, he died from the wound. That's\nwhat makes it true. But when did I kill him? Maybe we can't date that.\nSuppose we can't. If we can't, then there are facts that you can't\ndate, like the fact that I killed John. If there are facts that you\ncan't date, maybe here's another one. My death is bad for me. When is\nthat true? Can't date it, but for all that, maybe it's true. So maybe\nwe shouldn't accept the assumption of the argument that all facts can\nbe dated.\n\nOf course, the thought that all facts can be dated is a very\npowerful one, and no doubt, many of you are going to go home and start\ntrying to come up with an adequate answer to the question, when exactly\ndid Shelly kill John? And come up with an answer, maybe, that you can\neven accept.\n\nAt any rate, maybe we should accept the thought that all facts can\nbe dated. In which case, if we're going to want to insist that my death\nis bad for me, we'd better be able to come up with a date. Well, maybe\nwe can. When would it be plausible to claim my death is bad for me?\nWell, not now. My death can't be bad for me now. I'm not dead. But it's\nnot 100% clear that the other alternative isn't acceptable. Why not\nsay, \"My death is bad for me when I'm dead\"? After all, when is a\nheadache bad for me? When the headache is occurring.\n\nNow, according to the deprivation account, the badness of death\nconsists in the fact that when you're dead, you are deprived of the\ngoods of life. So when is death bad for you? During the time perhaps\nyou're being deprived of the goods of life. Well, when are you deprived\nof the goods of life? When you're dead. When does the deprivation\nactually occur? When you're dead. So perhaps we should just say, \"Well,\nyou were right, Epicurus,\" if this was Epicurus' argument. \"You were\nright, Epicurus. All facts have to be dated, but we can date the\nbadness of death. My death is bad for me during the time I'm dead.\nBecause during that time, I'm deprived of, I'm not getting, the good\nthings in life that I would be getting if only I were still alive.\"\n\nWell, that's a possible response to the objection. But of course, it\njust immediately raises a further objection. How could it be\nthat death is bad for me then? How could it be that death is bad for me\nwhen I don't exist? Surely, I have to exist in order for something to\nbe bad for me. Or, for that matter, for something to be good for me.\nDon't you need to exist in order for something to be good or bad for\nyou?\n\nWell, this points our way to a different possible interpretation of\nEpicurus' argument. The argument would be (A) something could be bad,\nor for that matter, good for you only if you exist; (B) when you're\ndead you don't exist; so (C) death can't be bad for you. Put that up on\nthe board. [See Figure 17.1] (A) Something can be bad for you only if\nyou exist. (B) When you're dead you don't exist. So, conclusion, (C)\ndeath can't be bad for you. Maybe that's the argument that Epicurus had\nin mind. Let's hear Epicurus'--the quote from Epicurus again. \"So\ndeath, the most terrifying of ills, is nothing to us, since so long as\nwe exist, death is not with us; but when death comes, then we do not\nexist. It does not then concern either the living or the dead, since\nfor the former it is not, and the latter are no more.\"\n\nAgain, the passage from Epicurus isn't altogether clear, but maybe\nhe's got in mind something like this argument. Maybe Epicurus thinks\nlook, (A) something can be bad for you only if you exist; (B) when\nyou're dead you don't exist; so (C) death can't be bad for you.\n\nWell, what should we say? It's pretty clear that (B) is true. When\nyou're dead you don't exist. And so the conclusion, (C) death can't be\nbad for you, looks like it's going to follow, once we accept (A). Call\n(A) the existence requirement. Something can be bad or, for that\nmatter, good for you, only if you exist. That's the existence\nrequirement for bads and goods.\n\nIf we accept the existence requirement, it looks as though we have\nto accept the conclusion, death can't be bad for you. What should we\nsay? Maybe what we should say is, reject the existence requirement. In\nthe ordinary case, pains, being blind, being crippled, what have you,\nlosing your job--in the ordinary case, things are bad for you when you\nexist. In the ordinary case, in order to receive bads, you've got to\nexist. But perhaps that's only the ordinary case; it's not all cases.\nPerhaps we should say, look, for certain kinds of bads you don't need\nto even exist in order for those things to be bad for you.\n\nWhat kind of bads could be like that? Well, of course, deprivation\nbads would be exactly like that. To lack something, you don't need to\nexist. Indeed, the very fact that you don't exist might provide the\nvery explanation as to why you've got the deprivation, why you've got\nthe lack. Not all lacks might be like that, right? Remember the\ntelevision case. You existed while you were being deprived of the great\nparty. You existed while you were getting the mere $10 instead of the\n$1,000. So, sometimes deprivations coincide with existence. But the\ncrucial point about deprivations is you don't even need to so much as\nexist in order to be deprived of something. Nonexistence\nguarantees that you're deprived of something.\n\nSo perhaps we should just reject the existence requirement. Perhaps\nwe should say, when we're talking about lacks, when we're talking about\ndeprivations, (A) is wrong. We should reject the existence requirement.\nSomething can be bad for you even if you don't exist. The existence\nrequirement is false. Well, that would be a possible way to respond to\nthis second possible interpretation of Epicurus' argument. It would be\na way to retain the thought that I take it we want to have, that most\nof us share, at least, that death is bad. We'd be able to retain that\nthought by rejecting the existence requirement.\n\nWell, easy to say that, but there are some implications of rejecting\nthe existence requirement that may be rather hard to swallow. Think\nabout exactly what it's saying. It's saying something, for example\ndeath, nonexistence, can be bad for somebody even though they don't\nexist. That's why my death can be bad for me even though I won't exist.\nBut if death can be bad for somebody even though they don't exist, then\ndeath could be bad for somebody, that is to say, nonexistence could be\nbad for somebody, who never exists. Take somebody who is a\npossible person, but never actually gets born.\n\nIt's sort of hard to think about somebody like that. So let's try to\nget at least a little bit more concrete. I need two volunteers. I need\na male volunteer from the audience. Good. Okay, you'll be the male\nvolunteer. And I need a female volunteer from the audience. Come on, it\nwon't hurt. I need a female volunteer. Okay. What I'd like you to do\nafter class is go have sex and have a baby. Okay.\n\nNow, let me just suppose that this isn't actually going to happen.\nSorry. Or sorry, I don't know. Let's consider, though, the possibility\nnever to be actualized, the possibility that they would have sex and\nhave a baby. His sperm joined with her egg, form a fertilized egg. The\nfertilized egg develops into a fetus. The fetus is eventually born.\nIt's the fetus that we got by mixing egg 37 with sperm 4,000,309.\nThere's a person that could have been born. But let's suppose,\nnever does get born. That particular person who could have been born,\nlet's call Larry. Okay. Larry is a possible person. It could happen,\nbut won't happen. It could exist, but won't exist. Now, how many of us\nfeel sorry for Larry? Probably nobody. After all, Larry never even\nexists. How can we feel sorry for Larry?\n\nNow, that made perfect sense when we accepted the existence\nrequirement, (A), something can be bad for you only if you exist. Since\nLarry never exists, nothing can be bad for Larry. But once we give up\non the existence requirement, once we say something can be bad for you\neven if you never exist, then we no longer have any grounds for\nwithholding our sympathy from Larry. We can say, \"Oh my gosh! Think of\nall the goods in life that Larry would have had, if only he'd been\nborn. But he never is born, so he's deprived of all those\ngoods.\" And if death is bad for me, by virtue of being deprived of the\ngoods of life, then nonexistence is bad for Larry, by virtue of his\nbeing deprived of all the goods of life. I've got it bad. I'm going to\ndie. Larry's got it worse. We should really feel much sorrier for\nLarry. But I bet none of you feels sorry for Larry, this\nnever-to-be-born-at-all person.\n\nNow, it's important in thinking about this, that we not slip back\ninto some version of the soul view, especially some version of the soul\nview where the souls are prior existents. You might imagine--there's a\nscene in Homer, I think, where some sort of sacrifice is being made and\nall the dead souls go hover around, longing to be alive again, to savor\nthe food and taste and smells of life, right? If you've got this\npicture of the nonexistent, merely potentially possible but never-to-be\nborn individuals as somehow really already existing in a kind of\nghost-like state, wishing they were born, maybe you should feel sorry\nfor them. But that's not what the story is at all on the physicalist\npicture that I'm assuming. Nonexistent people don't have a kind of\nspooky, wish-I-were-alive ghost-like existence. They just don't exist,\nfull stop. So once we keep that in mind about Larry, it's very hard to\nfeel sorry for him.\n\nOf course, look, since I've been going on about how he's deprived of\nall the good things in life, maybe some of you are feeling sorry for\nLarry. So it's worth getting clear about just what it would mean to\ntake seriously the thought that it's bad for merely potential people\nnever to be born. How many merely potential people are there? I want\nyou to get a sense of just how many there are. Not just Larry, the\nunborn person that would exist if we mixed whatever it was, you know,\negg 37 and sperm 4,000,029, whatever the number was. Not just Larry,\nwho's a potential person who never gets born, that would have to be an\nobject of our sympathy, there's a lot of merely potential,\nnever-to-be-born people.\n\nHow many? A lot. How many? Well, I once tried to calculate. Well, as\nyou'll see, the calculation is utterly off the back of the envelope,\nsort of rough and completely inadequate in ways that I'll point out.\nBut at least it'll give you a sense of just how many potential people\nthere are.\n\nLet's start modestly and ask: How many possible people could we, the\ncurrent generation, produce? Now as I say, I made this calculation some\nyears ago. It doesn't really matter how inaccurate it's going to be. As\nwe'll see, it's very rough, but it makes the point. How many people are\nthere? How many possible people, rather, could there be? Well, suppose\nthere were 5 billion people. Roughly half of them are men, half of them\nare women.\n\nWhat we want to know then is, how many possible people could the 2.5\nbillion men make altogether with the 2.5 billion women? The crucial\npoint in thinking about this is to realize that every time you combine\na different egg with a different sperm, you end up with a different\nperson, right? If you combine an egg with a different sperm, you get a\ndifferent genetic code that develops into a different person. You\ncombine that sperm with a different egg, you get a different person.\nYou know, if my parents had had sex five minutes earlier or five\nminutes later, presumably some other sperm would have joined with the\negg. That would have been not me being born, but some sibling\nbeing born instead of me. Change the egg, change the sperm, you get a\ndifferent person. So what we really want to know is, how many sperm-egg\ncombinations are there with roughly 5 billion people in the world?\n\nWell, let's see. [See Figure 17.2] There's 2.5 billion women,\n[writing] billion women. How many eggs can a woman have? Well, fertile\nperiods, round numbers, it's not really going to matter, precision,\nroughly 30 years, roughly 12 eggs a year. So that's how many eggs.\nActually, I discovered some time after having done this calculation\nthat the number of possible eggs is far greater. A woman actually\novulates and gives off this many eggs roughly during her fertile\nperiod. But there's many, many other cells, I gather, that could have\ndeveloped into eggs. So that's a much, much larger number of potential\neggs. But this will do. 30 years, 12 eggs a year.\n\nHow many men? Roughly 2.5 billion men. Each man has a much longer\nperiod in which he's able to produce sperm. Let's just be round numbers\nhere, 50 years. How many times a day can the man have sex? Well,\ncertainly more than once, but let's be modest here and just say once a\nday. So that's 365 times a day--a year. 365 days a year. 365 days, I\nguess that should be. I wrote it too big. I don't have space left for\nthe last number. Each time the man ejaculates, he gives off a lot of\nsperm. How much sperm? A lot. As it happens, I looked this up\nonce. Round numbers, 40 million sperm each time the man ejaculates. So\nthis last number has got to be times 40 million sperm. Okay, so we took\nall the men that exist now and all the women that exist now and ask:\nHow many merely possible people? You know, most of these people are\nnever going to be born, of course. But we're talking about possible\npeople.\n\nHow many possible people are there? There's 2.5 billion times 30\ntimes 12 times 2.5 billion times 50 times 365 times 40 million. That\nequals--I'm going to round here. That equals approximately 1.5 million\nbillion billion billion people. That's 1.5 x 1033. That's\nhow many possible people we could have, roughly speaking, in the next\ngeneration, of which obviously a miniscule fraction are going to be\nborn. There's--If you're going to feel sorry for Larry, you've got to\nfeel sorry for every merely possible person. Every person who\ncould have been born that never gets born. And there's\n1.5 million billion billion billion such people, such possible\npeople.\n\nAnd of course, the truth of the matter is, we barely scratched the\nsurface here. Because now think of all those people and think about all\nthe possible children they could have. We got this number\nstarting with a mere 5 billion people. Imagine the number we would get\nif we then calculated how many possible grandchildren we could have. I\ndon't mean that we could actually have all of those people at the same\ntime, but for each one there is a possible person that could have\nexisted. You quickly end up with more possible people than there are\nparticles in the known universe. And that was just two generations,\nright? Three generations, you're going to have more. Four generations,\nyou're going to have more. If we think about the number of possible\npeople, people who could have existed but will never exist, the number\njust boggles the mind.\n\nAnd then, if we say we've gotten rid of the existence requirement\nand so things can be bad for you even if you never actually exist, then\nwe have to say of each and every single one of those billions upon\nbillions upon billions upon billions upon billions of possible people\nthat it's a tragedy that they never get born, because they're deprived\nof the goods of life. If we do away with the existence requirement,\nthen the tragedy of the unborn possible people is a moral tragedy that\nmere--that just staggers the mind. The worst possible moral horrors of\nhuman history don't begin to even be in the same ballpark as the moral\nhorror of the loss, the deprivation for all of these unborn possible\npeople.\n\nNow, I don't know about you, when I think about it, all I can\nsay is it doesn't strike me as being a moral catastrophe. I don't feel\nanguish and sorrow and dismay at the loss, at the lack, at the\ndeprivation for the untold billion, billion, billion, billions. But if\nwe give up the existence requirement and explain the badness of my\ndeath via the deprivation account, we do have to say this is a moral\ntragedy, the fact that the billions upon billions are never born.\n\nWell, if we're not prepared to say that's a moral tragedy, well, we\ncould avoid that by going back to the existence requirement. But of\ncourse, if we do go back to the existence requirement, then we're back\nwith Epicurus' argument. Something can be bad for you only if you\nexist. When you're dead, you don't exist. So, (C), death can't be bad\nfor you. And now we've really got ourselves in a philosophical pickle,\ndon't we? If I accept the existence requirement, we've got an argument\nthat says death isn't bad for me, which is really rather surprising. I\ncan keep the claim that death is bad for me by giving up the existence\nrequirement. But if I give up the existence requirement, I've got to\nsay it's a tragedy that Larry and the untold billions, billions,\nbillions, billions--it's a tragedy that they're deprived of life as\nwell. And that seems unacceptable. What should we do? What should we\nsay? Well it seems to--suggestion, yeah?\n\nStudent: [inaudible]\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Good. The suggestion is that the key\nhere is to think about the claim that I'm using deprived in two\ndifferent senses. That when we worry about my death, I'm losing\nsomething--namely, life--that I've had. But in the case of Larry and\nthe untold billions, they never had life. And so they're not deprived\nof it in that same sense. I think it's a very promising suggestion. And\nindeed, I'm not 100% sure I've got exactly where you want to go with\nthis in mind, but I think there's a way of taking that thought and sort\nof carving a middle path.\n\nThe problem effectively was this. If we don't throw in any existence\nrequirement, we have to feel sorry for the unborn billion, billion,\nbillions. That doesn't seem acceptable. If we throw in the existence\nrequirement, (A), something can be bad for you only if you exist, we\nend up saying death isn't bad for me, because I'm not existing when I'm\ndead. But maybe there's a more modest way of understanding the\nexistence requirement. Or to put the point in slightly different terms,\nmaybe we can distinguish between two different versions of the\nexistence requirement, a bolder and a more modest version.\n\nLet's see. Here's the modest version. [writing] Something can be bad\nfor you only if you exist at some time or the other. Bolder claim.\nSomething can be bad for you only if you exist at the same time as that\nthing. All right. [See Figure 17.3] These are two different ways of\nunderstanding what the existence requirement requires. The modest\nversion is called modest because it's asking less. It says something\ncan be bad for you only if you exist at some time or the other. The\nbold existence requirement adds a stronger requirement. It says\nsomething can be bad for you only if you exist at the very same time as\nthe thing that's supposed to be bad for you. There's got to be a kind\nof simultaneity. If something's bad for you, you had better exist at\nthe very same time that that bad thing is happening. That's bolder than\nthe modest requirement. The modest requirement doesn't require that you\nexist that the same time as the bad thing. It only requires that\nyou exist at some time or the other.\n\nOne more minute, we'll finish up. Suppose we accept the bold claim.\nFor something to be bad for you, you have to exist at the very same\ntime as the bad thing. Then death can't be bad for you, because you\ndon't exist at the time of death. Suppose, however, that we accept the\nmodest requirement. For something to be bad for you, you have to exist\nat some time or the other. Well, since I do exist at some time or the\nother--after all, I exist right now--death can be bad for me.\nAdmittedly, I won't exist when I'm dead. But that's okay. The modest\nexistence requirement doesn't require that I exist at the very same\ntime as the bad thing. The bold one did, but the modest one doesn't. So\nthe modest one allows us to say that death is bad for me.\n\nBut notice, and this is the crucial point, it does not say that\nnonexistence is bad for Larry, because Larry never exists at all. And\nso he doesn't even satisfy the modest existence requirement. In short,\nwith no existence requirement, we have to say the unexistence of the\nbillions and billions is bad. That seems unacceptable. With the bold\nexistence requirement, we have to say death isn't even bad for me. That\nseems unacceptable. But if, instead, we accept the modest existence\nrequirement, we're able to say, nonexistence is not bad for\nLarry, but death is bad for me. And so that's the view that it\nseems to me we should be looking at. Okay.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct18.html":{"url":"lct18.html","title":"Lecture 18","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 18 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nMarch 29, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Last time I sketched the deprivation\naccount. That's a story or theory about what it is about death that\nmakes it bad. What's bad about death is the fact that, because you're\ndead, because you don't exist, you're deprived of the good things in\nlife. Being dead isn't intrinsically bad. It's not like it's an\nunpleasant experience. But it's comparatively bad. You're worse off by\nvirtue of the fact that you're not getting the things that you would\nget, were you still alive. If I'm dead I can't spend time with my loved\nones. I can't look at sunsets. I can't listen to music. I can't discuss\nphilosophy. The deprivation account says, what's bad about death is the\nfact that you're deprived of the good things in life.\n\nNow, that seems pretty plausible, as a basic story goes. But as we\nalso saw last time, there are some philosophical puzzles about how it\ncould be. The question of when is death bad for you, and even more\nimportantly and more essentially, there's the difficulty of asking\nourselves, do we really believe it's possible for something to be bad\nfor you, when you don't even exist? We saw a series of difficult\nchoices. If we don't throw in an existence requirement, if we don't\nsay--to put it more positively, if we say things can be bad for you\neven if you don't exist at all, then we're forced to say that things\nare bad for Larry.\n\nYou'll recall that Larry was our name for a potential person,\nsomebody who could have come into existence but never actually does or\nwill come into existence. Well, talk about people who are deprived of\nthe good things in life, Larry's completely deprived of the good\nthings in life. If we think it doesn't matter whether or not you exist,\nfor things to be bad for you, then we have to say, \"Oh, things are bad\nfor Larry.\" And not just Larry, but all of the 1.5 million, billion,\nbillion, billion never-to-be-born people. The number of potential\npeople is just staggering. And if we throw away an existence\nrequirement, we have to say it's a moral tragedy of unspeakable\nproportions that these people are never born, that they never come into\nexistence.\n\nNow, there are philosophers who are prepared to say that. But if\nyou're not prepared to say that, it looks as though you've got to\naccept some kind of existence requirement. Why don't we feel sorry for\nLarry and his billions upon billions of never-to-be-born compatriots?\nBecause, indeed, they don't exist. They're merely possible. And we\nmight say, you've got to exist in order for something to be bad for\nyou. But once we say that, it seems we're running towards the position\nthat, in that case, death can't be bad for me, because of course, when\nI'm dead, I don't exist. So how can anything be bad for me?\n\nI proposed at the end of class last time that we could try to solve\nthis problem by distinguishing between two versions of the existence\nrequirement--a more modest version and the bolder version. The bolder\nversion says, \"In order for something to be bad for you, you've got to\nexist at the very time that it's happening.\" If we say that, then\nindeed, we can say, \"It's not bad that Larry doesn't exist, because he\ndoesn't exist now.\" So there's nothing--even if we wanted to\nthink that there are good things he could be having, that's not bad for\nhim to not have them. He doesn't exist now. But it also, if we go all\nthe way to the bold existence requirement, we have to say, \"Look, when\nI'm dead that won't be bad for me, because, well, I won't exist\nthen.\"\n\nBut instead of accepting the bold existence requirement, we might\nsettle for something a little bit less demanding, the thing I dub \"the\nmodest existence requirement.\" In order for something to be bad for\nyou, there has to have been a time, some time or the other, when you\nexist. You've got to, as it were, exist at least briefly in\norder to get into the club, as we might put it, of those creatures,\nthose possible creatures that we care about and are concerned about\nmorally. You have to have gotten in the club by at least having existed\nfor some period of time. But once you're in the club, things can be bad\nfor you, even if you don't happen to exist at that particular\nmoment.\n\nIf we accept the modest existence requirement, then we can say, it's\nnot bad that Larry doesn't exist, because, well, Larry doesn't get into\nthe club. In order to get into the club of things that we feel sorry\nfor, you have to have existed at least some moment or the other. Larry\nand the billions upon billions upon billions of potential people who\nnever actually come into existence, they don't satisfy the requirement\nof having existed at some time or the other. So we don't have to feel\nsorry for them. But we can feel sorry for somebody who died last week\nat the age of 10 because we can say, well, they existed, albeit very\nbriefly. And so they're in the club of beings that we can feel sorry\nfor and say, look, it's bad for them that they're not still alive.\nThink of all the good things in life they would be getting if they were\nstill alive. So the modest existence requirement allows us to avoid\nboth extremes. Maybe then that's the position that we should\naccept.\n\nIt may be, on balance, the best possible view here. But I just want\nto emphasize that even the modest existence requirement is not without\nits counterintuitive implications. Consider somebody's life. Suppose\nthat somebody's got a nice long life. Comes into existence,\nleads--lives 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 years. Nice life. Now,\nimagine that we bring it about that instead of living 90 years, they\nhave a somewhat shorter life--10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years. We've caused\nthem to die after 50 years as opposed to the 90 years they might have\notherwise had. Well, we can say, look, that's worse for them--to live\nmerely 50 years instead of the full 90 or 100 years. And if we accept\nthe modest existence requirement, we can say that, because after all,\nwhether you live 50 years or 90 years, you did exist at some time or\nthe other. So the fact that you lost the 40 years you otherwise would\nhave gotten, well, that's bad for you. There. Fair enough. That gives\nus the answer we want. That's not counterintuitive.\n\nNow, imagine that instead of living 50 years, the person lives only\n10, 20 years and then dies. Well, that's worse still. Think of all the\nextra goods they would have gotten if only they hadn't died then. And\nif I caused them to die after 20 years instead of 50 or 90 years, I've\nmade things worse and worse. Imagine that I caused them to die after\none year. Worse still. All this is perfectly intuitive. The shorter\ntheir life, the worse it is for them, the more they're deprived of the\ngood things in life. So 90-year life, not bad. 50-year life, worse.\n10-year life, worse still. One-year life, worse still. One-month life,\nworse still. One day life, worse still. One-minute life, worse still.\nOne-second life, worse still.\n\nNow, imagine that I bring it about that the person never comes into\nexistence at all. Oh, that's fine.\n\nSee? That's the implication of accepting the modest existence\nrequirement. If I shortened the life they would have had so completely\nthat they never get born at all, or they never come into existence at\nall, then they don't satisfy the requirement of having existed at some\ntime or the other. So although we were making things worse and worse\nand worse and worse and worse as we shortened the life, when we finally\nsnip out that last little fraction of a second, it turns out we didn't\nmake things worse at all. Now we haven't done anything objectionable.\nThat's, it seems, what you've got to say if you accept the modest\nexistence requirement.\n\nOf course, if we didn't have an existence requirement at all, we\ncould say, \"Well look, worst of all, never to have been born at all.\"\nFair enough. But if you say that, then you've got to feel sorry for\nLarry. You've got to feel sorry for the 1.5 million billion, billion,\nbillions.\n\nSo which view is it that on balance is the--I don't want to say\n\"most plausible.\" I think when we start thinking about these puzzles,\nevery alternative seems unattractive in its own way. Maybe the most we\ncould hope for is, which is the least implausible thing to say\nhere? I'm not altogether certain.\n\nLet me turn to one more trouble or problem or puzzle for the\ndeprivation account. And this particular puzzle arises whether or not\nwe accept an existence requirement, whether or not we accept a bold\nexistence requirement, a modest existence requirement, or no existence\nrequirement, because we're going to deal with somebody who actually\ndoes exist at some time or the other, namely you or me. This is\nactually a puzzle that some of you may have written your paper on,\nbecause it's the puzzle about Lucretius, the puzzle that Lucretius\ngives us.\n\nIt's not a direct quote, but Lucretius basically says, look, most of\nus are upset and anxious at the fact that we're going to die. We think\ndeath is bad for us. There'll be this period after my death in which I\nwon't exist. And the deprivation account helps say why that's bad,\nbecause during this period of nonexistence, you're not enjoying the\ngood things in life.\n\nFair enough, says Lucretius, but wait a minute. The period after you\ndie isn't the only period during which you don't exist. It's not\nthe only period in which if only you were still alive, you could still\nbe enjoying the good things in life. There's another period of\nnonexistence. It's the period before my birth. I think I've just\nswitched the timeline here, but all right. Imagine this is the period\nbefore my birth. Just like there'll be an infinite period after my\ndeath in which I won't exist, and realizing that fills us with dismay,\nthere was, of course, an infinite period before I came into existence.\nWell, if nonexistence is so bad and by the deprivation account it seems\nthat we want to say that it is, shouldn't I be upset at the fact that\nthere was this eternity before I was born?\n\nBut, says Lucretius, that's silly, right? Nobody's upset about the\nfact that there was an eternity before they were born. In which case,\nit doesn't make any sense to be upset about the eternity after you die\nof nonexistence.\n\nWell, Lucretius doesn't offer this as a puzzle. Lucretius offers\nthis as an argument that we should not be concerned about the fact that\nwe're going to die. Most philosophers aren't willing to go with\nLucretius all the way to the end of the bus, bus route. Most\nphilosophers want to say there's got to be something wrong with that\nargument someplace. There's got to be some--\n\nWell, what are the possibilities here? One possibility is indeed to\njust agree with him, right? Nothing bad about the eternity before I was\nborn. So, nothing bad--of the eternity of nonexistence. So nothing bad\nabout the eternity of nonexistence after I die. That's one possibility,\nto agree with Lucretius.\n\nSecond possibility is to say, look, Lucretius, you're right. We\nreally do need to treat these two eternities of nonexistence on a par.\nBut we could turn it around. Instead of saying with Lucretius, nothing\nbad about this one, so nothing bad about this one, maybe we should say\ninstead, something bad about the one after we die, and so something bad\nabout the one before we were born. Maybe we should just stick to the\ndeprivation account and not lose faith in it. The deprivation account\nsays it's bad that there's this period after we die, because if only we\nweren't dead then, we would still be able to enjoy the good things in\nlife. Maybe we should say, look, similarly then, when the deprivation\naccount tells us it's bad that there's this period before we come into\nexistence, when we don't exist. Because if only we had existed then,\nwe'd be able to enjoy the good things in life. Maybe Lucretius was\nright, we have to treat both periods the same. But he's wrong in\nthinking we shouldn't think either period is bad. Maybe we should think\nboth periods are bad. Well, that's a possibility.\n\nWhat other possibilities are there? Another possibility is to say,\nLucretius, you're right, there are two periods of nonexistence, but\nthere's a justification for treating them differently. They're\nasymmetrical in a way that makes sense from the point of view of what\nwe should care about.\n\nWell, it's easy to say that. The puzzle--most philosophers\nwant to take that last way out. They want to say there's something that\nexplains why it makes sense, why it's reasonable, to care about the\neternity of nonexistence after my death, but where that doesn't apply\nto the eternity of nonexistence before my birth. And then the puzzle is\nto point to a difference that would justify that kind of rationally\nasymmetrical treatment of the two periods. It's easy to say it's\nokay, it's reasonable to treat them differently. The philosophical\nchallenge is to point to something that explains or justifies that.\n\nNow, a very common response is to say something like this. Look,\nconsider the period after my death. I'm no longer alive. I have\nlost my life. In contrast, the period before my birth, although\nI'm not alive, I have not lost my life. I have never yet been\nalive. And so, of course, you can't lose something you've never yet\nhad. So what's worse, this answer suggests, about the period after\ndeath, is the fact that death involves loss, whereas prenatal\nnonexistence does not involve loss. And so, the conclusion comes, and\nnow we see why it's okay to care more about that one than this one, the\none after death and the one before birth. Because the one after death\ninvolves loss, and the one before birth does not.\n\nVery, very common response, but I'm inclined to think that can't be\nan adequate answer. It's true, of course, that this period involves\nloss, because the very definition of \"loss\" is, you don't have\nsomething that at an earlier time you did have. So this period involves\nloss. But the period before birth does not involve loss, because\nalthough I don't have life, I haven't, previous to the period, had\nlife, so I haven't lost anything.\n\nOf course, there's another thing that's true about this prenatal\nperiod, to wit, I don't have life and I'm going to get it. So I\ndon't yet have something that's going to come in the future. That's not\ntrue about the post-life period. I've lost life. But it's not\ntrue of this period that I don't have life and I'm going to get it in\nthe future. So this period involves loss.\n\nInteresting. In fact, we don't have a name for this other state,\nwhere you don't yet have something that you'll get later, but you don't\nyet have it. Let's call that, not loss, let's call it \"schmoss,\" okay?\nSo during this period, there's a loss of life, but no schmoss of life.\nAnd in this period, there's no loss of life, but there's a schmoss of\nlife. And now we need to ask, as philosophers, why do we care more\nabout loss of life than schmoss of life? What is it about\nthe fact that we don't have something that we used to, that makes it\nworse than not having something that we're going to? It's easy to\noverlook the symmetry here, because we've got this nice word \"loss,\"\nand we don't have this word \"schmoss.\" But that's not really explaining\nanything, it's just pointing to the thing that needs explaining. Why do\nwe care more about not having what once upon a time we did, than we\ncare about not having what once upon a time we will?\n\nWell, there's some other proposals that we might make. A couple of\nthem have actually been sketched in some of your reading. So for\nexample, Tom Nagel [Nagel 1979], in his essay on death says, look,\nhere's the difference. It's easy enough to imagine--and indeed for\nthere to actually be a possibility of--my living longer. Suppose I die\nat the age of 80 and if I didn't die, then I'd continue living 90, 100,\nwhat have you. There it is. It's still me. When you imagine me with an\nearlier--rather with living longer, you're imagining me living\nlonger. To use the vocabulary that we introduced in thinking about some\nof Plato's arguments, we might say although --suppose I die at age\n80--that's a fact about me, it's a contingent fact about me.\nIt's not a necessary fact about me that I died at 80.\n\nSuppose at 80 I get hit by a car. It's not a necessary truth about\nme that I got hit by a car. I could have not gotten hit by a car, and\nlived to the ripe old age of 90 or 100. When you die is not an\nessential feature of you, so it's easy for us to think about the\npossibility in which I live longer. But, says Nagel, when I try to\nimagine what would the alternative be, if I'm going to be upset about\nthe prenatal nonexistence, we have to imagine my being born earlier. I\nwas born in 1954. Should I be upset about the fact that I was born in\n1954 instead of 1944? That's the analog of being upset about the fact\nthat I die in whatever it is, 2044 instead of living to 2054.\n\nNagel says, but look, when you try to think about the possibility in\nwhich instead of being born in 1954, I was born in 1944--and for the\nrest of you, you've got to plug in your own birthdates--Nagel says you\ncan't do it. The date of my death is a contingent fact about me. But\nthe date of my birth is not a contingent fact about me. And by\nbirth we don't really mean when I came out of the womb. That could be\nchanged, perhaps by having been delivered prematurely, or through\nCaesarean, or what have you. We really mean the time at which I come\ninto existence. Let's suppose it's the time when the egg and the sperm\njoin. That's not a contingent moment in my story. That's an\nessential moment in my life story.\n\nHow could that be? We say, couldn't my parents have had sex earlier,\n10 years earlier? Sure they could have. But remember, if they had had\nsex 10 years earlier, it would have been a different egg and a\ndifferent sperm coming together, so it wouldn't be me. It would\nbe some sibling of mine that, as it happens, never got born. But if,\nhad they had sex 10 years earlier, some sibling would have been born.\nThat's not me being born earlier. Different sperm, different egg makes\nfor a different person. So you can't--you can say the words, \"if only\nI'd been born earlier,\" but it's not actually metaphysically possible.\nWell, it's an intriguing suggestion, but I think it can't quite be\nright, or at the very least, it cannot be the complete story about how\nto answer Lucretius' puzzle.\n\nSuppose we've got a fertility clinic that has some sperm on hold,\nand has some eggs on hold, in the sperm bank, in the egg bank, what\nhave you. And they keep them here frozen until they're ready to use\nthem. And they thaw them out in whatever it is, 2020. And then the\nperson's born. Of course, he could go back. He could look back and say,\nif only they had put my sperm and egg together 10 years earlier. That\nwould still be me. After all, very same sperm, very same egg, makes for\nthe very same person. So if only they had combined my sperm and egg 10\nyears earlier, I would have been born 10 years earlier. Well, so\nNagel's wrong in saying it's not possible to imagine being born\nearlier. In at least some cases, it is. Yet, if we imagine somebody\nlike this, somebody who's an offspring of this kind of fertility\nclinic, and we ask, would they be upset that they weren't born earlier?\nagain, it still seems as though most people would say, \"No, of course\nnot.\" So the Nagel answer doesn't seem to me to be an adequate one.\n\nWell, there's another possible answer. This is Fred Feldman's\nanswer, also in the one of the papers that you've read. Fred Feldman\nsays--Nagel's a contemporary philosopher, Fred Feldman's a contemporary\nphilosopher. Feldman says, when I imagine--suppose I get killed by the\nbus in 2044, and if I imagine if only I hadn't died then, what is it\nthat we imagine? We imagine instead of living 80 years, living 90 or 95\nor more. We imagine a longer life.\n\nBut what is it that happens when I say, if only I'd been born\nearlier? Well, says Feldman, you don't actually imagine a longer life,\nyou just shift the entire life and start it earlier. After all,\nsuppose we just said--especially if I had asked you this question\nbefore setting all of this up--but if only you'd been born in 1800.\nNobody thinks, \"Oh, if only I'd been born in 1800, I'd still be alive.\nI'd be 200 years old.\" You think, \"Oh, if I'd been born in 1800, I\nwould have died in 1860, 1870, 1880,\" whatever it is.\n\nWhen we imagine being born earlier, we don't imagine a longer life.\nNothing better about having a life earlier, according to the\ndeprivation account. But when we imagine not dying when we actually\ndie, we say, \"If only I died in 2050 instead of 2040,\" it's not that we\nimagine having been born later. We don't shift the life forward.\nWe imagine a longer life. So, Feldman says, no wonder, no\nsurprise that you care about the nonexistence after death. Because when\nyou imagine that being different, you imagine a longer\nlife. But when you start thinking about the nonexistence before birth\nand you imagine that being different, you don't imagine\nmore goods in life, you just imagine them taking place at a\ndifferent time.\n\nWell, that's an interesting possibility, I suppose. It doesn't seem\nto me--again, that it's got to be--maybe it's part of the story, but it\ndoesn't seem like it's going to be the complete story. Because we could\nimagine cases where the person just thinks, look, if only I'd been born\nearlier, I would have had a longer life.\n\nLet's suppose that next week astronomers discover the horrible fact\nthat there's an asteroid that's about to land on the Earth and wipe out\nall life. So here it is, it's going to come on January 1, 2008. And\nthere you are, at whatever your age is, 20 years old, 21 years old, on\nJanuary-on December 31, 2008 thinking, I've only had 20 years of life.\nIf only I'd been born earlier. If only, instead of being born, whenever\nit was, I'd been born 10 years earlier, I would have had 30 years of\nlife instead of 20 years of life. That seems perfectly intelligible. So\nit does seem as though, if we put our head into it, we can get\nourselves into thought experiments where we say, yeah, don't just shift\nthe life, make it longer. But instead of making it longer in the\npost-death direction, make it longer in the pre-birth direction.\n\nAgain, you can imagine somebody saying, \"Yeah, and when we do that,\nwe should feel the same.\" It doesn't really matter which direction it\ngoes. So symmetry is the right answer after all. When I think about the\nasteroid example, I find myself thinking, huh, maybe symmetry is\nthe right way to go here. Maybe Feldman's right, that normally we just\nshift instead of extending. But if I'm careful to extend, maybe that\nreally is bad that I didn't get started sooner and have a longer\nlife in that direction.\n\nWell, here's one other answer that's been proposed. This is by yet\nanother contemporary philosopher, Derek Parfit. Parfit says, it's true\nthat when I think about the nonexistence after I die, that's loss,\nwhereas the nonexistence before I'm born, that's not loss, that's mere\nschmoss. And it's true that we need an explanation about why loss is\nworse than schmoss. But we can see that this is not an arbitrary\npreference on our part, because in fact, it's part of a quite general\npattern we have of caring about the future in a way that we don't care\nabout the past. This is a very deep fact about human caring. We are\noriented towards the future and concerned about what happens in it, in\na way that we're not oriented and concerned about what happened in the\npast.\n\nParfit's got a very nice example to bring the point home. He says,\nimagine that you've got some condition, some medical condition that\nwill kill you unless you have an operation. So fair enough, you're\ngoing to have the operation. This will allow you to live your life.\nUnfortunately, in order to perform the operation, they can't have you\nanesthetized. You have to be awake, perhaps in order to tell the\nsurgeon \"Yeah, that's where it hurts,\" whatever it is. Sort of like\nwhen the dentist pokes and says, \"Does this hurt? Does that hurt?\" So\nyou've got to be awake during the operation and it's a very painful\noperation. We can't give you pain killer, because then you won't be\nable to point out, does this hurt, does that hurt, and so forth and so\non. Since we can't give you pain killer, all we can do is this. So,\nyou'll be awake during this, basically being tortured. You'll be awake\nbeing tortured. It's still worth doing it, because this will cure the\ncondition, so then you'll have a nice long life.\n\nSince we can't give you pain killers and we can't put you out, all\nwe're going to do is, what we will do is this: After the operation is\nover, we'll give you this very powerful medication, which will give you\nshort-term, sort of very localized, amnesia. You won't remember\nanything about the operation itself. So you won't have to at least to\ndwell upon these horrible memories of having been tortured. Those will\nbe completely wiped out. Okay, so painful operation. You're awake\nduring it. After the operation, you're given this thing that makes you\nforget whether you've had the operation, anything about the operation\nat all. And that the preceding 24 hours will be completely wiped\nout.\n\nSo you're in the hospital and you wake up and you ask yourself,\n\"Huh, have I had the operation yet or not?\" Don't know, right? Because\nof course, if I haven't had it, no wonder I don't remember it, but if I\nhave had it, I would have been given that temporary sort of localized\namnesia. So of course I wouldn't know whether or not I've had it. So\nyou ask the nurse, \"Have I had the operation yet or not?\" She says, \"I\ndon't know, we have a couple on the hall today who are, some of whom\nhave had it and some of whom are scheduled to have it later today. I\ndon't remember which one you are. Let me go look at your file. I'll\ncome back and I'll tell you.\" So she wanders off. She's going to come\nback in a minute or two. And as you're waiting for her to come back,\nyou ask yourself, what do you want the answer to be? Are you\nindifferent, or do you care whether you're one of the people who's\nalready had it, or somebody who hasn't yet had it?\n\nNow, if you're like Parfit, and for that matter, like me, then\nyou're going to say, of course I care. I want it to be the case that\nI'm one of the people who's already had the operation. I don't\nwant to be one of the people who hasn't yet had the operation.\n\nYou might say, how can that make any sense? Your life's going to\nhave the operation sooner or later. At some point in your life history,\nthat operation is going to have occurred. And so there's the same\namount of pain and torture, regardless of whether you're one of the\npeople that had it yesterday or one of the people that's going to have\nit tomorrow. But for all that, says Parfit, the fact of the matter is\nperfectly plain, that we do care. We want the pain to be in the\npast. We don't want the pain to be in the future. We care more about\nwhat's happening in the future than we care about what's happening in\nthe past.\n\nThat being the case, no surprise we care about the nonexistence in\nthe future in a way we don't care about the nonexistence in the past.\nWell, that may be right as far as explanation goes, but we might still\nwonder whether or not it's any kind of justification. The fact that\nwe've got this deep-seated asymmetrical attitude towards time doesn't\nin any way, as far as I can see, yet tell us whether or not that's a\njustified attitude. Maybe evolution built us to care about the\nfuture in a way that we don't care about the past and this shows up in\nlots of places, including Parfit's hospital case, including our\nattitude towards loss versus schmoss, and so forth and so on. But the\nfact that we've got this attitude doesn't yet show that it's a\nrational attitude.\n\nHow could we show that it's a rational attitude? Well, maybe we'd\nhave to start doing some heavy-duty metaphysics, if what we've been\ndoing so far isn't yet heavy-duty enough. Maybe we need to talk about\nthe difference between--the metaphysical difference between the past\nand the future. The past is fixed, the future is open, the direction of\ntime. Maybe somehow we could bring all these things in and explain why\nour attitudes towards time make sense. I'm not going to go there. All I\nwant to say is it's not altogether obvious what the best answer to\nLucretius' puzzle is.\n\nSo when I say, as I have said--and I'm going to say it many times\nover the course of the remaining weeks--that the central thing that's\nbad about death is the fact that you're deprived of the good things in\nlife, when I make use of the deprivation account, I don't mean to\nsuggest everything is sweetness and light with regard to the\ndeprivation account. I think there are some residual puzzles about how\nit could be that death is bad. And in particular, how it could be that\nthe deprivation account puts its finger on what's bad about death.\n\nBut for all that, it seems to me the right way to go. It seems to me\nthat the deprivation account does put its finger on the central bad\nthing about death. Most centrally, what's bad about death is that when\nyou're dead, you're not experiencing the good things in life. Death is\nbad for you because you don't have what life would bring you, if only\nyou hadn't died. All right.\n\nIf that's right, should we conclude, in fact, do we have to\nconclude--if death is bad because of it's a deprivation, then if I\nwasn't dead, I wouldn't be deprived--so doesn't it follow then that the\nbest thing of all is never to die at all, to wit, immortality? If it's\nbad--suppose I get hit by a truck next week, that's bad, because if\nonly I hadn't gotten hit by a truck, I might have lived another 20, 30\nyears, whatever. I would have gotten the good things in life that would\nhave been better for me. Ah, but when I die of whatever it is, some\nheart disease at age 80, that's bad maybe because if only I didn't have\nheart disease, I could have lived another 10, 15, 20 years, gotten more\ngood things in life. If only I hadn't died at 100, I would have gotten\nmore good things in life. If only I hadn't died at 500, I would have\ngotten more good things in life. Whenever it is I die, won't it\nalways be true, if we accept the deprivation account, that if only I\nhadn't died then, I would have gotten more good things in life? And so\nwhenever it is you die, death is bad for you. So the best thing for you\nwould be never to die, immortality.\n\nTwo questions really that we need to ask. One is: Does consistency,\ndoes logic, require somebody who accepts the deprivation account--does\nconsistency require that if you accept the deprivation account, you\nbelieve immortality's a good thing? Second question: Even if logic\ndoesn't require that, is it true that immortality's a good\nthing? Let me start with the first one, because I think that's the\neasier one.\n\nLogic alone, logic plus the consistency requirement--rather and the\ndeprivation account--logic alone doesn't require us to say\nimmortality's a good thing. Why? Because strictly speaking, what the\ndeprivation account says is, death is bad insofar as you're deprived of\nthe good things in life by virtue of not existing. If only you hadn't\ngotten hit by that truck, you would have gone on to an exciting life in\nyour career as a professional dancer. You would have had a family, or\nwhat have you. Whatever it is. You would have traveled around the\nworld. Life would have given you a lot of great things and you get\ndeprived of those great things, that's why it's bad that you got hit by\nthe truck. That is to say, death is bad, when it's bad, by virtue of\nthe fact that it deprives you of the good things in life.\n\nBut suppose--we don't yet know whether this could actually happen,\nbut here we're just talking about logical possibilities--suppose that\nthere's no more good things for life to give you. Then when you're\ndeprived of life by death, you're not being deprived of any good\nthings, and so it's not bad for you to be dead at that point. Death is\nonly bad, according to the deprivation account, when there are good\nthings that would have come your way. When, as we might put it, on\nbalance, the life you would have had would have continued to be good\nfor you. When that happens, then to lose that good bit of life, that's\nbad for you. But if it should turn out that what life would have had\nhereafter, instead of being good, would have been hellish, it's not bad\nfor you to avoid that. It might actually be good for you to\navoid it. So, even if we accept the deprivation account, we're not\ncommitted to the claim that death is always bad. We have to look and\nsee, what would life actually hold out for us? Logic alone, plus the\ndeprivation account, doesn't force us to say immortality would be a\ngood thing.\n\nAfter all--this is really a crucial point to understand--things that\nare good for you in limited quantities can become bad for you if you\nget more and more and more and more of them. Well, I love chocolate. So\nsuppose somebody comes up to me with a box of Godiva chocolate, offers\nme a couple of chocolates. I say, \"Wonderful! I love Godiva chocolate.\"\nAnd then they give me some more and some more. Twenty pieces of\nchocolate. Well, you know, by the time I got 20 pieces of chocolate,\nI'm not sure right now if I really want the 21st piece. But\nyou keep giving me some more. Thirty pieces of chocolate, 40 pieces of\nchocolate, 100 pieces of chocolate. At some point--I've never actually\nhad his much chocolate; I don't know what the point is, but at\nsome point--I'm going to say, you know, although the first 10,\n20, 30 pieces of chocolate, those were good, but giving me the\n21st piece of chocolate or the 50th piece of\nchocolate, no longer good. Logically, at least, it could happen.\n\nLogically, it could happen that although in quantities, small\nquantities, 50 years, 60 years, 100 years, life is good, at some point,\nmaybe life would turn bad for us. Just like being force-fed more and\nmore chocolate. And if it did turn bad for us, the deprivation account\nwould allow us to say, oh, at that point, dying's not bad for you.\n\nWell, that's all that logic tells us. Logic simply tells us we don't\nhave to believe immortality's a good thing. But for all that, it\ncould still be a good thing. So that's question number two.\nLet's ask, what should we think about the prospect of living forever?\nWould it, in fact, be better and better and better? Somebody dies at\nage 10 by some horrible disease, better if they'd made it up to 40.\nSomebody dies at age 40, better if they'd made it up to 80. Somebody\ndies at age 80, better if they'd made it to 100, 120. Is it true that\nlife would get better and better and better, the longer it is?\n\nNow, in asking this question, we have to be careful to be clear\nabout what exactly we're imagining. Here's one way to try to imagine\nthat story. Imagine that life is sort of the way it works now, with the\nkinds of changes that bodies undergo as they get older. But instead of\nthose changes basically killing you at 80, 90, or 100, they don't. You\nget more and more of those changes, but they never actually kill you.\nThis is the sort of thought experiment that Jonathan Swift undertakes\nin the passage from Gulliver's Travels that I've had you look\nat. He imagines Gulliver coming to a country where a subset of the\npeople live forever, immortals. And at first, Gulliver says, \"Oh, isn't\nthis wonderful?\" But he forgot to think about the fact that if the\nkinds of changes that we undergo continue to accumulate, then you're\ngetting older. Not just older, but weaker, in more and more discomfort,\nsenility sets in with a vengeance, until eventually you've got these\ncreatures that live forever, but their mind is gone, and they're sort\nof in pain and they can't do anything because their body's utterly\ninfirm and diseased and sick. That's not a wonderful thing to have. If\nimmortality was like that, says Swift, that would be horrible.\nFor an immortality like that, death would be a blessing. And Montaigne,\nin the essay that I've had you look at, says indeed, death is a\nblessing, because it puts an end to the pain and suffering and misery\nthat afflict us in our old age.\n\nWell, all of that seems right, but I suppose we'd be forgiven for\nthinking, look, when we wanted to be immortal, we didn't want\nthis kind of life going on and on and on with the same\ntrajectory, the same downward trajectory. We sort of wanted to live\nforever, hail and hearty and healthy. So even if the real world\nwouldn't allow us that, let's just ask science fictiony whether or not\nin fact living forever would be good. Isn't it at least true that in\nprinciple, living forever could be good? You've got to imagine changing\nsome of the facts about what it would be like to live forever.\n\nSo instead of asking the question, the question I started with,\nwould it be good to live forever? --If you're not careful, this is\ngoing to be like one of those horror stories, right? Where you've got a\ncouple of wishes and you aren't careful about how exactly you state the\nwish. And so you get what you want, but it ends up being a nightmare,\nright? If you just tell the fairy who gives you three wishes, \"I want\nto live forever,\" and you forgot to say \"and be sure to keep me\nhealthy,\" well, that's going to be a nightmare. That's what Swift told\nus. So let's be careful. Let's throw in health and anything else you\nwant. Throw in enough money to make sure you're not poor for eternity.\nWouldn't that be horrible, to be healthy but impoverished\nforever? Throw in whatever you want. All we need to ask at that this\npoint is, is there any way at all to imagine immortality, where\nimmortality of that sort would be a good thing? Is there any way to\nimagine existing forever where that would be good for you,\nforever?\n\nNow, it's very tempting at this point to say, look, of course.\nNothing could be easier. Just imagine being in heaven forever,\nright? You're done, right? You've got heavenly bliss. Isn't this\nincredible? Wouldn't we all love to be in heaven forever? The trouble\nis, we were a little bit vague about what exactly life is like in\nheaven. It's a striking fact that even those religions that promise us\nan eternity in heaven are rather shy on the details. Why? Because, one\nmight worry, if you actually tried to fill in the details, this\nwonderful, eternal existence ends up not seeming so wonderful after\nall.\n\nSo imagine that what's going to happen is that we all become angels\nand we're going to spend eternity singing psalms. Now, I like psalms\nand I actually enjoy rather singing psalms at services. On Saturday\nmornings, I sing psalms in Hebrew and I rather enjoy it. But if you ask\nme: What about the possibility of an eternity of doing that? That\ndoesn't really seem so desirable. Bedazzled, not the remake. I\nhaven't seen the remake, but the original. In the original, there's a\nhuman character who hooks up with the devil. He meets the devil and he\nasks the devil, \"So why did you rebel against God?\" The devil says,\n\"Well, I'll show you. You sit here on the--\" whatever it was, the\nmailbox, I think it was. \"I'll sit up here on the mailbox,\" the devil\nsays. \"And you dance around me and say, ‚ÄòOh, praise the lord, aren't\nyou wonderful? You're so magnificent. You're so glorious.'\" And the\nhuman does this for a while and he says, \"This has gotten really\nboring. Can't we switch?\" And the devil says, \"That's exactly what I\nsaid.\"\n\nNow, when you try to imagine heaven singing psalms for eternity,\nthat doesn't seem so attractive. All right, so don't imagine heaven\nsinging psalms for eternity. Just imagine something else. But what?\nImagine what? This is the thought experiment that I invite you to\nparticipate in. What kind of life can you imagine, such that having\nthat life forever would be good? Not just for another 10 years, not\njust for another 100 years, not just for another 1,000 years, or\nmillion years, or a billion years. Remember, eternity is a very, very\nlong time. Forever goes on forever. Can you describe an\nexistence that you would want to be stuck with forever?\n\nNow, it's precisely at this point that Bernard Williams, in another\none of the papers I had you take a look at--Bernard Williams says no\n[Williams 1978]. No kind of life would be one that would be desirable\nand attractive forever. No kind of life at all. In short, says\nWilliams, every life would eventually become tedious and worse,\nexcruciatingly painful. Every kind of life is a life you would\neventually want to be rid of. Immortality, far from being a wonderful\nthing, would be a horrible thing.\n\nSuppose, for the moment, that we were to agree with Williams. What\nthen should we say? We might say--look, at least when we're being\ncareful, if we agree that immortality would be bad, we can't say then\nthat death, per se, is bad. The very fact that I am going to die turns\nout not to be a bad thing, because after all, the only alternative to\ndying is immortality. And if immortality would be a bad thing,\nthen death is not a bad thing. Death is a good thing. We\nmight say, if we accept Williams' thought, the fact of our mortality is\ngood rather than bad, if immortality would eventually be bad.\n\nNow of course, crucial to notice that even if we say this, that\ndoesn't mean that when you get hit by a car tomorrow, that that's good.\nYou don't have to say that. You can still say it's a bad thing that I\ngot hit by a car tomorrow, because after all, if I hadn't gotten hit by\na car tomorrow, it's not as though I would have been condemned to\nimmortality, I just would have lived another 10 or 20 or 30 years. And\nthose years would have been good ones for me. And maybe even when I\ndie--let's suppose I live to the ripe old age of 100--when I die at\n100, I could perhaps still say, it's a bad thing for me that I die at\nthe age of 100. Because if I hadn't died now, I might have lived\nanother 10, 20, 30 years and still enjoyed things in life, enjoyed\nplaying with my great grandchildren, whatever it is.\n\nTo say that immortality is bad is not to say it's a good thing that\nwe die when we do. You can still believe\nconsistency--consistently--that we die too soon. Even if in\nprinciple, eventually, sooner or later, death would no longer be bad,\nit could be that it comes too soon for all of us.\n\nStill, the question we want to ask is, is there any way even to\nimagine an immortal life that would be worth having? In\nprinciple, could immortality be a good thing? Or, is Williams right,\nthat no, even in principle, go as fantastic and science fictiony as you\nwant, in principle an immortal life could not be desirable? So until\nnext time, I invite you to think that question through. If you're\ntrapped into the prospect of immortality, what would the best\nkind of immortal life be like?\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n---\n\nResources\n\nNagel, Thomas. 1979. \"Death.\" In Mortal Questions.

The question we turned to was, just let your imagination\nrun free. Instead of asking what would it be like to continue living a\nlonger kind of trajectory that humans have in the real world where you\njust get sicker and more and more frail and incapacitated, ask yourself\nnot whether immortality of that sort would be valuable, but is\nit even so much as possible to describe a life that you would\nwant to live forever? That's the question I left you with last\ntime.\n\nI think I already tipped my cards on this matter. I'm inclined to\nagree with Williams. I think that no matter how we try to fill in the\nblank, it's a very long blank. The crucial point here for us is that\nimmortality means not just living a very long time or even an\nextraordinarily long time, but literally living forever. I think it's\nvery difficult, indeed I think it's impossible, to think of anything\nyou'd want to do forever.\n\nI have a friend who once claimed to me that he wanted to live\nforever so that he could have Thai food every day for the rest of,\nwell, the rest of eternity. I like Thai food just fine, but the\nprospect of having Thai food day after day after day after day for\nthousands, millions, billions, trillions of years no longer seems an\nattractive proposal. It seems like it becomes some kind of a nightmare.\nAnd the same way that I indicated previously that although I like\nchocolate--I love chocolate--the prospect of having to eat more\nand more and more and more and more chocolate, eventually the idea\nbecomes a sickening one.\n\nThink of any activity. Some of you may enjoy doing crossword\npuzzles, and perhaps doing crossword puzzles a couple hours a day is\nenjoyable. But imagine doing crossword puzzles every day for 10 years,\n1,000 years, a million years, a billion years, a trillion years.\nEventually, presumably, so it seems to me, you'd end up saying, \"I'm\nreally tired of crossword puzzles.\" Sure, there'd be some new\nparticular puzzle you hadn't seen before, but you'd sort of step up a\nlevel and say, \"Although I haven't seen this particular one before,\nI've seen crossword puzzles before. There's really nothing new under\nthe sun here. The fact that I haven't seen this particular combination\nof words isn't enough to make it interesting.\"\n\nWell, crossword puzzles aren't a very deep subject, and we might\nwonder whether or not we would do better if we were engaged in\nsomething more mentally challenging than that. This may indicate\nsomething unusual about me, but I rather like math. And the prospect of\nhaving a lot of time to pursue math problems of a richer and deeper\nsort seems fairly attractive. Yet even there, when I imagine an\neternity of thinking about math--or for that matter, an eternity of\nthinking about philosophy, which I obviously like even more than\nmath--the prospect seems an unattractive one. I can't think of any\nactivity I'd want to do forever.\n\nNow, of course, that's a bit of a cheat because the claim isn't to\nspend eternity doing math problems and nothing but math problems. Right\nnow, with our 50, 80, 100 years, we don't fill our day doing only one\nkind of activity. We fill our day with a mixture of activities. But it\ndoesn't really help having Thai food for dinner and Chinese for lunch.\nOr perhaps Chinese on Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays and Thai on\nSaturdays and Sundays and spending two hours in the afternoon doing\nmath and three hours in the morning doing philosophy. That sounds like\na pretty pleasant life. But again, if you think of the possibility of\ndoing that for all eternity and never getting away from it,\nnever being free from it, the positive dream of immortality, I think,\nbecomes a nightmare.\n\nWell again, maybe I'm not just being creative enough in my\nimagination. Different former colleague of mine once talked about the\nprospect of having a kind of heavenly vision of the divine. Maybe that\nwould be desirable forever. And she described it as, think of what it's\nlike to have a really great conversation with a friend that you wish\nwould never end, except God's this infinitely rich friend and so the\nconversation ends up seeming desirable forever. Well again, I can say\nthe words, but when I try to imagine that possibility and take it\nseriously, at least speaking personally, it doesn't--it doesn't hold\nup. No friend that I've ever talked with is one that I actually\nwould want to spend eternity talking to. And it's of course\npossible to say, well, just imagine a friend that you would want to\ntalk through all eternity to. But the whole point is, I can't imagine\nwhat that would be like. When I do my best to imagine some kind of\nexistence that would be desirable or attractive forever, it just\ndoesn't work. It becomes a nightmare.\n\nWell again, maybe what we need to do is not so much just imagine the\nsame cycling going through week after week after week, but whole\ncareers. Maybe you could spend 50 or 100 years pursuing philosophy as\nyour career. And then 50 or 100 years pursuing math as your career. And\n50 or 100 years traveling around the world. And 50 or 100 years being\nan artist and working on your water colors, or whatever it is. Well,\nthat certainly seems like we could probably get more time out of that.\nBut again, the crucial point to remember is that forever is literally\nforever. There's no life that I'm able to imagine for myself\nthat's one that I would want to take on forever.\n\nWell, you might say surely there could be creatures that\nwould want to live forever, that would enjoy an eternal\nexistence. And I think that's probably right. So scientists have\nlearned how to do the following. There are certain--you can take a rat\nand put an electrode in his brain. If you put the electrode in just the\nright place, then when the electrode gets turned on, it stimulates the\npleasure center in the rat's brain and it gets a little burst of\npleasure, a pretty intense burst of pleasure. And in fact, you can take\nthe wire, the electrode, and hook it up to a lever and teach the rat\nhow to push the lever and give itself a little burst of pleasure. Now,\nwhat happens to rats when you do this? Well, maybe unsurprisingly, what\nthey do is, they keep pressing the lever. Indeed, they press the lever\nand they'll stop eating, they're no longer interested in sex. They\nbasically just give themselves this little orgasmic burst of\npleasure--well, until they die.\n\nNow well, of course, it's too bad the rat dies, but if we imagine\nthe rat not being mortal--perhaps you've got it on IV so it's getting\nits nutrients that way--then perhaps it's easy to imagine the rat\nsimply pressing the lever forever, getting this intense burst of\npleasure and being content to do that for all eternity. So if it's so\neasy to imagine that for the rat, why not for us? Why not just put our\nown orgasmitron hat on with a little--not rat lever, but now human\nlever--with the electrodes stimulating our own brains so that we get\nthis intense burst of pleasure? And just imagine this intense burst of\npleasure going on forever. What could be more desirable than that?\n\nExcept, when I think about that, and I invite you to think about\nthat, I don't actually find that an especially attractive prospect.\nMind you, it's not that I think we couldn't be stimulated to get\npleasure forever. It's that there's something that distinguishes humans\nfrom rats. When I--No doubt I would enjoy it. And no doubt you would\nenjoy it for a very long time. But I imagine that after a period,\nthere'd be this--Well, humans have this ability to look down on their\nexperiences, or step back from their experiences, and assess them. Even\nnow, as I'm sitting here lecturing to you, part of me, because of this\nvery question that I'm raising, is thinking about how's the lecture\ngoing, and am I going to get through what I need to get through, and so\nforth and so on. We can reflect on our first order or base level\nexperiences.\n\nNow, imagine then that you're in the pleasure-making machine. After\na while, part of you is going to start asking, \"Huh, say, it feels the\nsame as it was yesterday, and the day before that and the day before\nthat. I imagine this is how it's going to feel tomorrow, and the day\nafter that and the day after that.\" And eventually this question would\nstart, \"Is this really all there is to life, just simple pleasure like\nthis?\" The thing about being human is, unlike the rat, you're not just\ngoing to stay caught up in the moment. You're going to take this\nmeta-level or higher level standpoint, look down at the pleasure and\nwonder, \"Is this all that there is to life?\" And I think eventually\nthat question would gnaw at you and sour and override the pleasure.\nEventually, you'd become horrified that you were, in effect, stuck in\nthis rat-like existence. Of course, the human part of you is able to\nsay there's more to you than this rat-like existence. But\nprecisely, the human part of you is going to rebel at the unending\nparade of simple rat-like pleasures. So, I don't think an eternity like\nthat would be such a good thing. Maybe it would be for a rat, but not\nfor a human.\n\nOf course, we could perhaps deal with that problem by making us more\nrat-like in terms of our thinking processes. Perhaps the right kind of\nlobotomy would do the trick. I don't actually know exactly what it\nwould take, but you just cut off and snip the relevant nerve endings so\nthat we're no longer able to engage in that higher order thinking. No\nlonger able to raise the question, \"Is this all there is?\" No longer\nable to step back from the first order pleasure. No doubt, you can turn\nus into creatures like rats in that way. And then, I presume, we would\ncontinue to enjoy it forever.\n\nBut the question isn't really, is there something you could do to a\nhuman being so that he'd be happy, or at least enjoying himself,\nforever? It's rather, do you, sitting here now, thinking about that\nkind of life, do you want that for yourself? Do you want to be\nlobotomized where that's the only way, at least that we've got so far,\nto imagine a life that you would enjoy forever. Sure. Screw me up\nenough and maybe I'd enjoy being alive forever. But that doesn't mean\nthat I now want that for myself. That doesn't seem to me to be some\ngift you've given me. That seems to me to be some horrible penalty\nyou've imposed on me, that you've reduced me from being a human being,\nable to engage in the full range of reflection, and simply turned me\ninto something like a rat. So again, when the question is posed, \"Is\nthere a kind of life that I or you would want to live forever?\" the\nquestion I'm asking is a question to you, here, now. Is there a kind of\nlife that you would want to live forever? Not that, if we\naltered you, that that product would want to have forever. I can't see\nhow to do it.\n\nWell look, there's one other possibility. Instead of imagining\nlobotomizing us, turning us into rats, suppose we just say, look, the\nproblem is really this. The problem, of course, is boredom. The problem\nis tedium. The problem is that you get tired of doing math after a\nwhile, 100 years, 1,000 years, a million years, whatever it is. You\nsay, \"Yeah, here's a math problem I haven't solved before, but so what?\nI've just done so much math, it holds no appeal to me before.\" Or, you\ncycle through all the great art museums in the world and you say,\n\"Yeah, I've seen these Picassos. I've seen these Rembrandts before.\nI've gotten what there is to get out of them. Isn't there anything\nnew?\" And the problem is no, no. We've--even if there's literally new\nthings, they're not the new kinds of things that can still engage us\nafresh.\n\nWell, what's the solution to that? The solution to that might be a\nkind of amnesia, a kind of progressive lack of memory. So here I am,\n100 years, 1,000 years, around 500,000 years, whatever it may be.\nYou're getting pretty bored with life. But if we now introduce some\nprogressive memory, so--a progressive memory loss--so that I know\nlonger remember what I did 100,000 years earlier. And by the time I'm a\nmillion, I no longer remember what I was doing when I was a lad of\n500,000. And by the time I'm a million and a half, I no longer remember\nwhat was happening in oh, back, back. I know I was alive, perhaps. Or\nmaybe I don't even remember that I was alive. I sort of remember the\nlast 10-20,000 years and that's it.\n\nAnd while we're at it, why don't we have overhauling of your\ninterests and desires, your tastes? So your tastes in music evolve over\nthousands of years. And your tastes in art or literature. Or, you like\nmath now but then you lose your taste in math, and you become the kind\nof person perhaps who's interested in Chinese poetry, whatever it is.\nWouldn't that do it? If we had this sort of progressive all-radical\nalteration, not just minimal alteration, but radical alterations of my\nmemory, my beliefs, my desires, my tastes. Couldn't that be a kind of\nexistence that would be forever enjoyable and yet it wouldn't be a\nrat-like existence? I'd be engaged in studying Chinese poetry. I'd be\nengaged in doing math. I'd be engaged in studying astronomy, what have\nyou. That's far better than the rat's existence. And yet, at no point\ndo I become bored, because, roughly, I'm so different from period to\nperiod to period. Well, I think actually, you probably could tell a\nstory where that was true, especially if we throw in enough doses of\nmemory loss.\n\nBut this case should remind you of something, because this case is\none that we've actually discussed before under the label of\n\"Methuselah.\" Methuselah, remember, when we talked about personal\nidentity, we imagined somebody--much shorter-lived at that time. I\nthink it was several hundred years, a hundred years old, 200 years old,\n300 years old, 600, 700, 800, 900 years old. By the time Methuselah was\n900 years old, he no longer remembered anything about his childhood.\nWhat I found when I thought about the Methuselah case was, even though\nit was me at age 800, the same person as the one who's standing here in\nfront of you now, it didn't really matter. I said, \"So what?\" When I\nthought about what I wanted in survival, it wasn't enough that there be\nsomebody in the distant future that be me. That wasn't good enough. It\nhad to be somebody with a similar enough personality.\n\nYou tell me, \"Oh there's going to be somebody alive. It'll be you,\nbut it'll be completely unlike you. Different tastes, no memories of\nhaving taught philosophy and so forth.\" I say, that's all rather\ninteresting from a metaphysical point of view, but speaking personally,\nI don't really care. It's of no interest to me to survive, and merely\nsaying the mantra, \"Oh, but it's me\" doesn't make it more desirable to\nme. What I want isn't merely for somebody to be me. I want them to be\nsufficiently like me. And the problem with the Methuselah case\nwas, go far enough out, it's no longer sufficiently like me. So I don't\nreally care that there'll be somebody out there who's still me, if\nthey're so unlike me now.\n\nBut that's, after all, what we've just described, in imagining the\ncycling with the memory loss. Yeah, there'll be somebody around 100,000\nyears from now, 500,000 years from now, and maybe they'll be me. I\ndon't care. It doesn't give me what I want when I want to\nsurvive. So perhaps we should put the point in the form of a dilemma.\nCould immortality be something worth having forever? Well, on the one\nhand, if we make it be me and similar to me, boredom's going to\nset in. The only way to avoid that is to lobotomize me, and that's not\ndesirable. If we make--If we solve the problem of boredom setting in\nwith progressive memory loss and radical personality changes, maybe\nboredom won't set in, but it's not anything that I especially want for\nmyself. It just doesn't matter to me that it's me, anymore than it\nwould matter to me if they just tell me, \"Oh, there'll be somebody else\naround there who will like Chinese poetry.\"\n\nSo, is there a way of living forever that's attractive to me? I\ncan't think of what it would look like. So, I agree with Bernard\nWilliams when he says immortality wouldn't be desirable. It would\nactually be a nightmare, something you would long to free yourself\nfrom.\n\nNow, having said that, of course, that doesn't in any way mean that\nit's a good thing that we die when we do at 50 or 80 or 100. From the\nfact that after 100,000 years or a million years or whatever it is,\neventually life would grow tiresome, that hardly shows that life has\ngrown tiresome after 50 years or 80 years or 100. I don't believe\nwe'll--I'll--come close to scratching the surface of what I would enjoy\ndoing, by the time I've died. And I imagine the same thing is true for\nyou.\n\nSo perhaps the best form of life would be not immortality; I think\nthat would be not particularly desirable. And not what we've got now,\nwhere you live after a mere drop of 50 or 80 or 100 years. But rather,\nthe best thing I suppose would be to be able to live as long as you\nwanted. This is the sort of thing that Julian Barnes basically imagines\nin the chapter \"The Dream\" that I had you take a look at. Barnes\nenvisions heaven as a situation which you can stick around doing what\nyou want to do for as long as you want to do it. But Barnes says,\neventually you'll have enough. And once you've had enough, you can put\nan end to it. Still--the fact that we can put an end to it, that's the\npoint we've already been flagging, that immortality would not be so\ngood. But the new thought here is what would be good would be being\nable to live until you were satisfied, until you'd gotten what goods\nthere were to get out of life.\n\nWhat all this suggests, then, and this is a point that I really made\nbefore, is that the best understanding of the deprivation account\ndoesn't say that what's bad is the mere fact that we're going to die.\nIf I'm right in thinking immortality would be undesirable, then the\nfact that we're going to die is good, because it guarantees that we\nwon't be immortal, which would be a nightmare, an unending nightmare.\nStill, even though it's not a bad thing that we will die, it could\nstill be a bad thing that we die when we do. It could still be\nthe case that we die too soon.\n\nAccording to the deprivaton account, death is bad, when it's bad,\nbecause of the fact that it deprives us of the good things in life,\ninsofar as we would have continued to get good things in life. But if\nlife would no longer have anything good to offer you, if what you then\nwould have had would have been something negative instead of something\npositive, then at that point, dying wouldn't actually be a bad thing.\nIt would be a good thing. Death is bad insofar as it deprives you of a\nchunk of life that would have been good. Insofar as it deprives you of\na future that would have been bad, then death's not actually bad, it's\nactually good.\n\nNow, in stating this view this way, I'm obviously presupposing that\nwe can make these kinds of, at least, overall judgments in terms of the\nquality of your life, how well off you are. Is life giving you good\nthings, or is life giving you bad things? Is it worth continuing to\nlive, or is it not worth continuing to live? So, I want to turn to that\ntopic and spend oh, probably the better part of a lecture or so. The\nrest of today and some of next time talking about the question of,\nwell, what is it for a life to go well? How do we assess what\nmakes a life--a good life versus a bad life? And I don't mean morally\ngood life. I mean, good for the person whose life it is. A life\nthat you think, \"I'm benefiting from having this life.\" What are the\ningredients or constituents or elements of a good life versus a bad\nlife? And of course, since it's not just black and white, good life or\nbad life, but various shades of gray, better lives and worse lives,\nwhat's the yardstick by virtue of which we measure better and worse\nlives? What goes into a good life?\n\nNow, in thinking about this question, this is--you might think of\nthe topic as the nature of wellbeing. And like all the other topics\nwe've talked about in this class, it's a complicated subject, about\nwhich one could spend a great deal of time. All we're going to do here\nis really just, once again, scratch the surface. But the very first\npoint that needs to be made, I think, is this. If you start listing all\nthe things worth having in life, it might seem as though you couldn't\npossibly come to any general organizing principles. Think about it.\nWhat's worth having? Well yeah, jobs are worth having. Money's worth\nhaving. Sex is worth having. Chocolate's worth having. Ice cream's\nworth having. Air conditioners are worth having. What are some of the\nthings worth avoiding? Well, being blind is worth avoiding. Being\nmugged is worth avoiding. Diarrhea is worth avoiding. Pain's worth\navoiding. Getting unemployed is worth avoiding. War is worth\navoiding.\n\nWhat kind of systematicity could we possibly bring to all of this?\nWell, the crucial, I think, first distinction is this. We need to\nseparate between those things that are good because of what they lead\nto. That is, more strictly, only because of what they lead to.\nAnd those things that are valuable for their own sake or in their own\nright. Take something like a job. A job's worth having. Why is a job\nworth having? Well, a job's worth having because, well, among other\nthings, it gives you money. All right. Money's worth having. All right.\nWhy is money worth having? Well, money's worth having because, among\nother things, you can buy ice cream with it. All right. Why is ice\ncream worth having? Well, ice cream's worth having because when I eat\nice cream it gives me this pleasurable sensation.\n\nAll right. Why is the pleasurable sensation worth having? At this\npoint, we get a different kind of answer. At this point, we say\nsomething like, pleasure is worth having for its own sake. The other\nthings were valuable as a means, ultimately to pleasure. But pleasure\nis worth having for its own sake. The things that are valuable as a\nmeans we can say are instrumentally valuable. The things that are worth\nhaving for their own sake, philosophers call intrinsically valuable. If\nwe look back at that long, open-ended list of things that were good or\nbad, we'll find that most of the things on that list are instrumentally\ngood. They're good because of what they lead to. Or, for that matter,\ninstrumentally bad. Why is disease bad? Well, among other things, it\nmeans perhaps that you can't enjoy yourself. So it deprives you of\npleasure. Or perhaps it means because you're sick, you can't hold your\njob down. If you can't hold your job down, you can't get the money and\nso forth and so on. Ultimately, most of the negative things on that\nlist were instrumentally bad. Most of the good things on that list were\ninstrumentally good.\n\nIf we want to get anyplace on the question about the nature of the\ngood life, what we need to focus on is not the instrumental goods and\nbads, but rather the intrinsic goods and bads. You've got to ask\nyourself, \"What's worth having for its own sake? What's worth having in\nand of itself?\" Well, one natural suggestion is that pleasure is worth\nhaving for its own sake and pain is probably worth avoiding for its own\nsake. So pain's probably intrinsically bad; pleasure is intrinsically\ngood. Notice by the by that logically speaking, there is nothing that\nstops the very same thing from being both. And actually you can get\nother weird combinations. You go to the dentist and he pokes you. He\nsays, \"Does this hurt? Does that hurt?\" in order to try to figure out\nwhere there's gum disease. And the pain that he causes is intrinsically\nbad. In and of itself it's bad. Yet, for all that, it's being useful\nthere. It's providing a means of deciding where the gum has decayed.\nAnd that allows the dentist to improve your gums, which avoids more\npain down the road. So the pain you're suffering now is actually\ninstrumentally valuable, useful as a means, even though it's\nintrinsically bad.\n\nSimilarly, when I work, I enjoy myself. And so the pleasure I'm\ngetting then is intrinsically good. But it's also instrumentally good.\nThe fact that I'm enjoying myself makes it easier for me to work\nharder. Perhaps I'm more productive, I do better at my job. So the\npleasure is both intrinsically valuable and instrumentally valuable. So\nthere's no claiming that things have to be one or the other, but not\nboth. Still, in trying to get clear about the nature of wellbeing, the\ncrucial thing to do is to focus not on the question about instrumental\nvalue, but rather to focus on the question of intrinsic value. What\nthings are worth having for their own sake, whether or not those things\nalso have instrumental value, or what have you?\n\nWhat things are worth having for their own sake and what things are\nworth avoiding for their own sake? Well, in giving these examples, I've\nalready indicated at least two things that belong on the list. It seems\npretty plausible to think pleasure is intrinsically good. One thing,\nmaybe not the only thing, but at least one thing, that goes into a life\nworth having is enjoying it, is pleasure. And one thing that seems\nintrinsically bad, one thing that seems to reduce the value of a life,\nis pain. Most of us agree then, pleasure is intrinsically valuable;\npain is intrinsically negative, unvaluable, has anti-value.\n\nWell, suppose we make for, the moment, the bold conjecture, the\nphilosophical claim, that not only is pleasure and the absence of pain,\nnot only is pleasure one good thing and pain one bad\nthing. Suppose that's the entire list. Suppose we conjecture that the\nonly thing intrinsically valuable is pleasure and the only thing\nintrinsically bad is pain. That view is called hedonism. So hedonism is\na view that many people are attracted to, perhaps some of you believe.\nIt's got a very simple theory of the nature of wellbeing. Being well\noff is a matter of experiencing pleasure and avoiding or minimizing the\nexperience of pain. That's hedonism.\n\nA little later we'll turn to the question of, well, if hedonism is\nnot the right story, what else belongs on the list, or is it the right\nstory? We'll turn to that question a little bit later. But notice that\nif we've got hedonism or, for that matter as we'll see, some other\ntheories of wellbeing, if we've got hedonism, we're able to make the\nkinds of evaluations that I was helping myself to when I started\ntalking a few minutes ago about well, you know, if what life would hold\nfor you is bad overall, then you're better off dying and so forth.\n\nWhat's going on when we make those judgments? Well, the hedonist\noffers us a very simple straightforward answer. In deciding whether\nwhat life holds for you is worth having, better than nothing, you,\nroughly speaking, add up all the good times and subtract all the bad\ntimes and see whether the net balance is positive or negative. Add up\nall the pleasures, subtract all the pains. If the balance is positive,\nyour life is worth living. And the more positive the balance, the\nbigger the number, the more your life is worth living. If the balance\nis negative though, think about what that would mean. If the balance\nwas negative, you're saying your future holds more pain overall than\npleasure. And that's a negative. You'd be better off, well, you'd be\nbetter off dead, right? Because if you were dead, you'd have neither\npleasure nor pain. That's going to presumably be given--mathematically\nif we gave it a number, we'd slap a zero on that. No positive number,\nno negative number. That's a zero. Obviously, if the balance of\npleasure over pain is positive, that's better than zero. But if the\nbalance of pain over pleasure--If there's more pain than pleasure so\nthat the balance is negative, that's worse than zero. That's a life not\nworth having. That's what the hedonist says.\n\nNow, there's different ways of working out the details of the\nhedonist view. It's not, after all, as though all pleasures count\nequally or all pains count equally. The pain of stubbing your toe\nobviously doesn't count for nearly as much as the pain of a migraine,\nwhich doesn't count nearly as the pain of being tortured. And so we\nmight need to work out various, more complicated, formulas here, where\nwe multiply the pain times its duration and take into account its\nintensity, get the sheer quantity of pain that way. And\nsimilarly, pleasures can be longer lasting, or more intense. You can\nimagine how some of those details might go, and then some of the\nquestions get rather tricky. But for our purposes, we don't really need\nto worry about the details. The thought is, roughly, weigh up the\npleasures and pains in some appropriate way. Add up the pleasures. Add\nup the pains. See whether the grand total of pleasures is greater than\nthe grand totals of pain. The more positive the number, the better your\nlife.\n\nNow, armed with an approach like this, we can do more than just\nevaluate entire lives. Well, one thing we can do is just that. We can\nevaluate entire lives. There you are at the pearly gates and you look\nback on your life and you could, in principle, add up all the\npleasures, add up all the pains, subtract the pains from the pleasures\nand ask yourself, \"How good a life did I have? How well off was I,\nhaving lived that life?\" And perhaps then you could imagine alternative\nlives. If only I had chosen to become a doctor, instead of having\nchosen to become a lawyer. How much better off or worse off would I\nhave been? Or if I decided to become an artist or a scholar or a beach\nbum or a farmer, how much better off or worse off would I have been?\nHow much greater or smaller would the number go?\n\nDespite my talking about numbers, of course, there's no particular\nassumption that we can really give precise numbers to this. And we\ncertainly don't think that in fact most of us are in the position to\nactually crank out any kind of accurate number. Most of us don't know\nenough to know with a high degree of accuracy how things would have\ngone had I decided to become a farmer instead of a philosopher. Still,\nthe hedonist isn't saying from a practical point of view we can\nnecessarily do this. But in theory, in principle, this is what we're\nwondering about when we face choices. We can ask ourselves, \"What would\nour life look like? Would it be better or worse?\" And the yardstick\nthat we're at least doing our best to apply is one of measuring up the\npleasure and subtracting the pain.\n\nAnd of course, the hedonist will also hasten to point out that just\nbecause we can't do this perfectly or infallibly, that doesn't mean we\ncan't make educated guesses, right? You're trying to decide should you\ngo to Yale for college or should you go to Ohio State or Harvard or\nwherever else you got into, and you ask yourself, well, you try to\nproject your future and you ask, \"Where do I think I'd be better off?\nWhich of these branches that are available to me, the branches of my\nlife story, which is the one in which the future from here on out holds\nmore pleasure and holds less pain?\" That's how the hedonist says we\nshould think about it.\n\nAnd notice by the by, that when we make choices about our future,\nfrom the hedonist point of view, at least, there's no particular need\nto dwell a whole lot on the past, because what's done is done. You're\nnot going to alter how much pleasur you enjoyed previously, how much\nsuffering you've undergone previously. What's open is the future. And\nso we're able to evaluate not just lives as a whole, looking back at\nthe pearly gate. We're able to evaluate lives from here on out. Which\nof the various futures that are open to me are likely to give me the\nbetter life, leave me better off, measured in terms of pleasure or\npain? And we do our best, however good or bad that may be. We do our\nbest to make such comparative evaluations.\n\nAnd of course, we can do more than just evaluate the entire rest of\nmy life. We can evaluate the next year or the next six months or, for\nthat matter, just this evening. I can talk about, well, what should I\ndo tonight? Should I stay home and work on my paper? Should I go to the\nparty? Where will I be better off tonight? Well, I'll probably enjoy\nmyself more at the party than I will working on the paper. And the\npaper's not due for a while and so forth. We make evaluations not just\nof entire lives, but of chunks of lives.\n\nAll right. That's what we can do if we accept hedonism. But haven't\nyet asked, should we accept hedonism? Now, it will not come as\nnews to me if I were to learn that several of you, maybe even many of\nyou, in this class accept hedonism. It's a very popular view. Not just\namong philosophers where it's a view that's been around as long as\nthere's been philosophy, but among people in the street. It's a very\ntempting view to think, what makes life worth having and the only thing\nworth having for its own sake, is having pleasure and avoiding pain.\nBut for all that, despite the popularity of that view, I'm inclined to\nthink it must be wrong. It's not that I think pleasure isn't good and\npain isn't bad. Where hedonism goes wrong is when they say it's the\nonly thing that matters. I'm inclined to think there's more to\nthe best kind of life than just having pleasure and avoiding pain.\n\nNow, I already revealed that, when I was talking about the rat lever\nmachine. I said, hook me up to that machine and I'll enjoy myself. But\nI don't want that for myself. Why? Because there's more to life\nthan just pleasure and the absence of pain, or so it seems to me.\n\nStill, we might say, but the rat lever is not the only kind of\npleasures there are. There's all these pleasures of experiencing art\nand seeing a beautiful sunset. And I don't know about you, but at least\nwhen I imagine the rat lever thing, it's a sort of simple,\nundifferentiated pleasure. So, that really won't do the trick in giving\nus the best quality pleasures of the kinds that humans most crave--the\npleasures of friendship and discussion and sexual intimacy. These\npleasures the rat lever machine wasn't giving us.\n\nSo couldn't hedonism still be true? Couldn't it still be the case\nthat as long as we take into account the importance of getting the\nright kinds of pleasures, then really pleasure is what it's all\nabout and all that it's about? No, I think that's still not right. But\nindeed, we'll need to move to something fancier than the rat lever\nmachine. Here, the relevant thought experiment was suggested by Robert\nNozick, a philosopher who died a few years ago, taught for many years\nat Harvard.\n\nNozick invited us to imagine an experience machine. So, suppose that\nthe scientists have discovered a way not just to stimulate the\nparticular little pleasure center of the brain, but basically to--give\nyou basically, completely realistic virtual reality. So that when you\nare hooked up to the machine, it seems to you exactly the same on the\ninside as it would seem to you if you really were--and now fill in the\nblank. You could have the identical experience of climbing Mount\nEverest, let's say, so that you'll feel the wind bracing you. Of\ncourse, you won't really feel any wind. Strictly speaking, that's not\ntrue, because you're not up on Mount Everest. There is no wind. What's\nreally going on is you're floating in the psychologist's tank in their\nlab with the electrodes hooked up your brain. But you don't know that\nyou are floating in the tank. Hooked up to the machine, you believe you\nare climbing Mount Everest. You feel the thrill of having made it to\nthe top and the wind bracingly striking your chin and you feel the\nsatisfaction and you've got the memories of having almost died when the\nrope broke before.\n\nIt's not like being at the IMAX. The crucial point, when you're at\nthe IMAX is, although it's very realistic, part of you is aware that\nyou're just in the theatre. But on the experience machine, you don't\nknow you're just in the lab. When you're on the experience machine,\nyou've got--your brain is being stimulated in such a way that you've\ngot the identical experience on the inside to what it would feel like\nif you really were doing these things.\n\nSo, imagine a life on the experience machine. Imagine plugging in\nthe tape. Says something about how old this example is that we talk\nabout plugging in the tapes. Imagine plugging in the DVD, or whatever\nit is, with all of the best possible experiences. Whatever you think\nthose are. Here, you might imagine different people disagreeing\nabout--oh, but throw in something--but if what you want to do is write\nthe great American novel, then you've got the experience of staying up\nlate at night not knowing how to make the plot work out, crushing\npieces of paper and throwing them away. Crushing your computer, or\nwhatever it is that you do as you write the great American novel.\n\nOr you want to be finding the cure for cancer. So you've got exactly\nthe experience you would have if you were working in your lab having\nthe brilliant breakthrough when you finally realize what the\ncombination is that would make the right antibody, whatever it is. Or\nif you want to be observing all the most beautiful sunsets and the most\nexotic locales, you've got exactly the experience you would have if you\nwere doing all these things.\n\nThat's life on the experience machine. You're not doing any\nof it. You're floating in the lab. But the experiences are identical.\nNow, ask yourself then, would you want to spend your life hooked up to\nthe experience machine? Ask yourself, how would you feel if you\ndiscovered now that you have been living your life hooked up to\nan experience machine?\n\nNow, I've got to make a footnote here. This perfectly glorious\nphilosophical example has been ruined in recent years by the movie\nThe Matrix. Because whenever I tell this story now, people start\nsaying, \"Oh, well the evil machines are busy using your body as a\nbattery\" or whatever it was in the movie, right? And \"What if people\nare nefariously feasting on my liver while I'm having these little\nexperiences?\" Don't imagine any of that. It's not that the evil\nscientist is just deliberately deceiving you so as to conduct his\nnefarious experiments. Nothing like that.\n\nAnd similarly, while we're at it--this is not a Matrix-like\nworry--if you're worried about, yeah, but what's happening to world\npoverty while I'm doing all of this? Just imagine that everybody's\nhooked up to experience machines, but everybody's got the best possible\ntapes. Now you ask yourself, what I'm asking you to ask yourself, is\nwould you want to spend your life hooked up to the experience machine?\nI'm not talking about, wouldn't it be interesting to try it out for a\nweek or a month or even a year? And indeed, the question, strictly\nspeaking, isn't even would life on the experience machine be better\nthan it is now? Although it would make me very, very sad to discover\nthis, I suppose it's possible some of you have such bad lives that\nmoving on to the experience machine would be a step up. That's not the\nquestion.\n\nThe question is, does life on the experience machine give you\neverything worth having in life? Everything worth having\nin life. Is it the best possible form of human existence? According to\nthe hedonists, the answer's got to be, it has to be \"yes.\" Life on the\nexperience machine is perfect, as long as you've got the right tape\nplugged in. So, you've got the best possible balance of wonderful\npleasures and wonderful, fantastic experiences, since that's all there\nis to human wellbeing. By hypothesis, the machine is giving us that.\nThere couldn't possibly be anything more. There couldn't possibly be\nanything missing.\n\nBut when I think about the question, would I want to spend my life\nhooked up to an experience machine? the answer is \"no.\" And I imagine\nthat for most of you, when you ask yourself, would you want your entire\nlife to be spent hooked up to the experience machine? your answer is\n\"no.\" But if the answer is \"no,\" then that means hedonism's got to be\nwrong. If life on the experience machine is not everything, then\nthere's more to the best possible life than getting the insides right.\nThe experience machine gets the pleasures right, gets the experiences\nright, gets the mental states right, it gets the insides right, but if\nlife on the experience machine isn't all that's worth wanting out of\nlife, then there's more to the best possible life than getting the\ninsides right. What we've got to turn to next time, then, is the\nquestion, what else might it be? Okay.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct20.html":{"url":"lct20.html","title":"Lecture 20","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 20 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nApril 5, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Last time, I invited you to think\nabout life on the experience machine, where the scientists are busy\nstimulating your brain in such a way as to give you an exact replica,\nfrom the insides of what it would be like having identical experiences\nto the ones you would have if you were really doing--well, whatever it\nis that's worth doing. Climbing the alps, writing the great American\nnovel, raising a great family that loves you, being creative. Whatever\nit is you think is worth having, the experience machine gives you all\nthe experiential side of those things. But you're not really doing\nthose things. You're actually just floating in the scientist's lab.\n\nAnd we ask ourselves, would you want to live a life on the\nexperience machine? Would you be happy or would you be unhappy, to\ndiscover that you actually have been living a life on the experience\nmachine? Most of us, when we think about this, find ourselves wanting\nto say, no, we wouldn't want to have a life on the experience machine.\nI've been discussing this sort of example for many, many years. And\nthere's always a group of people who think, yes, life on the experience\nmachine is perfect as long as you've got the right tape playing. But\nthe vast majority always says, no, there's something missing from that\nlife. It's not the ideal of human existences; it's not the best\npossible life we can imagine ourselves having.\n\nBut that means, if we think something's missing, we then have to ask\nyourselves, what's missing? What's wrong with the experience machine?\nThe one thing we can conclude immediately is, if you think life on the\nexperience machine is missing something, that the hedonist--and views\nlike hedonism--must be wrong, insofar as they say that all that matters\nfor the best possible life is--for well-being--is getting the right\nkinds of experiences, getting the right kinds of mental states. Because\nby hypothesis, the experience machine gets the mental states right, get\nthe insides right. So, if something's missing from that life, there's\nmore to the best kind of life than just having the right mental states,\nthan just getting the insides right.\n\nWell, we ask ourselves then, well, what's missing? I think different\npeople will answer that in different ways. And if we had more time we\ncould spell out rival theories of well-being, which could be\ninterestingly distinguished one from another in terms of how they\nanswer the question, \"What's missing from the experience machine?\" on\nthe one hand, and \"Why are the things that are missing from the\nexperience machine worth having?\" Different theories of well-being\nmight answer that in different ways. Instead of trying to pursue those\nalternative theories in a systematic fashion, let me just gesture\ntoward some of the things that seem to be missing from that kind of\nlife.\n\nWell, first of all, and most, perhaps, obviously--if you're just\nspending your life floating in the scientist's lab, you're not actually\naccomplishing anything. You're not actually getting the things out of\nlife you thought you were getting. You wanted to be climbing the\nmountain, but you're not actually climbing a mountain. You're just\nfloating there. You wanted to be writing the great American novel, but\nyou're not writing the great American novel. You're just floating\nthere. You wanted to be finding the cure for cancer, but you're not\nactually finding the cure for cancer. You wanted to be loved, but\nyou're not actually loved. You're just floating there. Nobody other\nthan the scientist even knows that you exist. So, there's a variety of\nthings you wanted. You wanted to know your place in the universe, but\nyou don't even have that kind of knowledge either, because you think\nyou're writing novels, finding the cure for cancer, climbing Mount\nEverest. You're completely deceived about all those things. So you\ndon't have the kind of self-knowledge that many of us value.\n\nWell, as I say, different theories would try to systematize these\nexamples in different ways; that we don't have any kind of\naccomplishments, we don't have knowledge, we're not in the right kinds\nof loving relationships. Different theories might have different\nexplanations as to--are these things valuable because we want them, or\ndo we want them because we recognize they're valuable?\n\nRather than trying to pursue those questions--, And indeed, trying\nto work out the details of these views would be complicated as well.\nTake the example of accomplishment. Well, we all think accomplishment's\nimportant, but it's not as though any old accomplishment is important.\nIf somebody sets themselves--or so it seems to me at least--if somebody\nsets theirself the goal of making the biggest rubber band ball in the\nEastern United States, I suppose there's a sense of the word that\nthat's an accomplishment if they've got it, but it doesn't strike me as\nthe kind of accomplishment which makes for a particularly valuable\nlife. So, we might have to distinguish between any old accomplishment\nand genuinely valuable accomplishments. But again, just put those\ndetails aside.\n\nWe can say that there are certain things that are good above and\nbeyond experiences--the right kinds of accomplishments, the right kind\nof knowledge. After all, not every bit of knowledge is equally\nvaluable. It's one thing to know your place in the universe, or to know\nthe fundamental laws of physics. It's another thing to know what was\nthe average rainfall in Bangkok in 1984. I'm not clear that that kind\nof knowledge gives a whole lot of value to your life. So, we need the\nright kinds of accomplishments and the right kind of knowledge and the\nright kinds of relationships.\n\nBut imagine you've worked that out. The crucial point is that it\ntakes more to have the best kind of life than just getting the insides\nright. It also requires getting the outsides right--whatever that comes\nto--having in your life not just experiences but the right kinds of\ngoods or accomplishments or whatever term we use for it.\n\nNow, let's say, instead of pursuing the questions of how exactly\nthat theory should go, notice that if we had that theory we could still\nevaluate in principle--whatever the practical difficulties might be--in\nprinciple we could still evaluate rival lives. We could talk about\nadding up all the positive experiences along with all the--ask yourself\nhow many goods, how many accomplishments of the right sort were in that\nlife? And that's on the positive side of the ledger. And against that\nwe would then have to subtract the sum total of the negative\nexperiences, all the failures and deceptions or what have you. Those\nwould count against the overall value of your life. We could still say\nit's--how good your life is, is a matter of adding up the goods and\nsubtracting the bads. But we would now have a somewhat broader, or more\nencompassing or inclusive, list of goods, and a more broad and\nencompassing list of bads--not just experience, but also these various\nother accomplishments, whatever exactly that list comes to.\n\nSo, we could still evaluate rival lives. My life would've gone\nbetter had I chosen to become a farmer instead of chosen to become a\ndoctor. Or my life would've gone better for this period of ten years,\nbut then it would've become worse. Or what have you. Or when we ask\nourselves, how will things go for me over the next couple of weeks if I\ngo on vacation versus staying back here? We add up the goods, subtract\nthe bads--whatever our favorite list is--and we come to our best\neducated guess about the rival evaluations of not just lives as a\nwhole, but chunks of lives.\n\nNow, what do those totals come to? Well, you might think it's an\nempirical question, and in fact I am inclined to think it's an\nempirical question, varying from person to person. But it's worth\ntaking a moment to flag the fact that there are people, there are\nphilosophers, who think we can generalize across all humans. You might\nsay that optimists are people who think that for everybody in every\ncase, in every circumstance, the total is always positive. \"Life's\nalways worth living; it's always better than non-existence.\" That's\nwhat the optimist thinks--not just for themselves individually, but for\neverybody, the total is always positive.\n\nAgainst that, I suppose, you've got pessimists--pessimists who say,\n\"No, no. Although life perhaps has some good things, the overall grand\nbalance is negative for everybody in every circumstance. We'd all be\nbetter off dead, or perhaps more accurately still, all be better off\nnever having been born in the first place.\" That's what the pessimists\nsay.\n\nAnd in between the optimists on the one hand and the pessimists on\nthe other, you've got moderates who say, \"It varies. And for some\npeople the balance is positive, for some people perhaps the balance is\nnegative, whether for their life as a whole or for certain stretches of\ntheir lives.\" We then have to get down to facts about cases, try to\ndescribe the instance, perhaps somebody who's in the terminal stages of\nsome illness where they're in a great deal of pain. And the various\nother external goods of life, they can't--because they're bedridden,\nthey can no longer accomplish things, perhaps their family has\nabandoned them. Whatever the details might be, we could describe lives\nand say, whether or not their life was good as a whole, what the future\nholds out for them is negative. That's what the moderates would say. It\nvaries from case to case.\n\nWell, however we settle that issue, notice there's still one other\nassumption that all these positions still have in common. We've\nexpanded our list of goods so that--Nobody's going to deny that among\nthe goods of life are pleasure and other positive experiences. And\namong the bads of life are pain and other negative experiences. But\nwe've expanded the list of goods so it includes external goods and not\nonly experiential or internal goods.\n\nStill, the views that I've been sketching all still have the\nfollowing assumption in common. How good it is to be alive is a matter\nof adding up all of the--call it the contents of life. Add up\nyour experiences and your accomplishments and the particular details of\nyour life as what the story is about. It's as though we've been\nassuming, and I have been assuming up to this moment, that being alive\nper se has no value. It's--life itself is a container which we fill\nwith various goods or bads. And deciding how valuable it is, how good\nit is for me to be alive is a matter of adding up the value of the\ncontents of the life. But the container itself is a mere container. It\nhas no value in and of itself. We could say that what I've been\npresupposing up to this point is the \"neutral container theory\" of the\nvalue of life. Hedonism is a version of the neutral container theory.\nHow valuable--how well off you are, how valuable your life is, is a\nfunction of the contents, the pleasure and the pain. We've expanded the\nlist of goods that can go within your life, but for all that,\nwe've still been acting as though the neutral container theory is the\nright approach.\n\nBut against this there are those who think, no, in addition to\nthinking about the value of the content of life, we have to\nremember--so these people claim--that life itself is worth having.\nThere's a benefit to me above and beyond the question of what's going\non within my life--am I loved, am I accomplishing things, am I having\nnice experiences or not? Above and beyond the question of the contents\nof my life, we have to remember that the mere fact that I'm alive gives\nmy life some value. So, these are \"valuable container\" theories.\n\nNow, think about what it would mean to accept a valuable container\ntheory. You're saying that being alive per se has some positive value.\nWell, actually, the first remark is, probably wouldn't be completely\naccurate to say, to describe these views as saying, \"It's being alive\nper se.\" After all, a blade of grass is alive, and I presume that even\nfans of the, what we might call valuable container theories, don't\nthink that, \"Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful if--as long as I was alive in\nthe way that a blade of grass is alive.\" Life may have value in and of\nitself, but it's not mere life. What we want is the life of a\nhuman. We want a life in which we're accomplishing things, there's\nagency, and the life of knowing things. Because you have to be a knower\nin order to have knowledge. The life of somebody who can have an\nemotional side. So, it's something like the life of a person that, when\nwe say, when there are people who are inclined to say, that being alive\nper so is valuable, presumably what they mean is being alive as a\nperson per se is valuable. All right. Note that point; keep it in mind.\nFor simplicity I'll talk about these views as though they say life per\nse is valuable.\n\nActually, I suppose there could be a more extreme view still. It\nseems implausible to me, but I suppose it's worth noticing there are\npeople who think, \"No, being alive per se, right--even though there I\nam and my brain has been so thoroughly destroyed that I'm not longer\nable to know anything, no longer able to relate emotionally to anybody,\nno longer able to accomplish anything, there I am in a persistent\nvegetative state, but at least I'm alive.\" You can imagine somebody who\nhas that view. I've got to say I find that a pretty implausible view.\nSo I'm going to restrict myself, at least when I think about it, to\nversions that say, it's the life of a person per se that's\nvaluable.\n\nNow, notice that if we accept this view to decide how well off I am,\nor somebody else is, you can't just add up the contents of the life.\nYou can't just add up all the pleasures and subtract the pains, or add\nup all the accomplishments and subtract the failures, or add up all the\nknowledge and subtract the ignorance and deception. Doing that in terms\nof the contents gives you a subtotal, but that subtotal is no longer\nthe entire story. Because we also have to add in, if we accept a\nvaluable container theory, we also have to add in some extra positive\npoints to take account of the fact that, well, at least you're alive or\nhave the life or a person--or whatever it is that you think is valuable\nin and of itself. So first we get the content subtotal; then we add\nsome extra points for the mere fact that you're alive.\n\nNow, notice that since we are adding extra positive facts, extra\npositive points, for the fact that you're alive, even if the contents\nsubtotal is negative, the grand total could still be positive.\nSuppose that being alive per se is worth plus a hundred points, just to\nmake up some number. Even if your content subtotal was negative ten,\nthat doesn't mean you're not better off alive, because negative ten\nplus the extra hundred points for the mere fact that you're alive is\nstill going to give you a positive total, plus 90. So, the point of\nthinking about the possibility of accepting a valuable container theory\nis to remind us that in deciding are you better off dead, has death\ndeprived me of something good or not, it's important to not just focus\non the contents but to also remember to add some positive points above\nand beyond the content subtotal to take into account the value of the\nsheer fact that you're alive.\n\nIf you're a fan of the neutral container theory, you won't have\nanything extra to add, because life per se is just a zero. It's\nstrictly a matter of the contents. But if you accept a valuable\ncontainer theory, you have to add something more. And so even if, you\nmight say, the way my life is going in terms of its contents is bad,\nbeing alive per se might still be a good thing. Have to add some extra\npoints.\n\nHow much extra? Well, here we're going to have, of course, more\nmodest and more bold versions of the valuable container theory. Let me\njust distinguish two broad types. What we might call modest versions of\nthe valuable container theory say, although being alive per se is good,\nif the contents of your life get bad enough, that can outweigh the\nvalue of being alive so that the grand total is negative. Modest\ncontainer theories, that is, say there's a value to being alive,\nbut it can in principle be outweighed. Whether it gets outweighed\neasily, or whether it's very, very difficult and the contents have to\nbe horrible to outweigh it, depends on how much value you think being\nalive per se has. So, those are modest theories--positive value for\nlife, but it can be outweighed.\n\nAgainst that, you can imagine someone who thinks being alive per se\nis so incredibly valuable that no matter how horrible the\ncontents are, the grand total will always be positive. It's as though\nbeing alive is infinitely valuable in comparison to questions about the\ncontents. We could call this the \"fantastic valuable container theory\"\nas opposed to the \"modest valuable container theory.\" I suppose that\nlabel gives away where I want to come down on this. I find the\nfantastic valuable container theory fantastic in the sense of\nincredible. I can't bring myself to believe it, which--I have some\nsympathies for valuable container theories, but I also have some\nsympathy for neutral container theories. Sometimes I'm drawn toward the\nneutral view; sometimes I'm drawn toward the thought that being alive\nper se is good for you. But even in those moments when I'm drawn\ntowards valuable container theories, it's always the modest version. I\ndon't find myself drawn toward the fantastic version.\n\nNow, if we make these distinctions, then again, remembering that the\nquestion we've been asking ourselves is, \"So why is death bad?\" The\ndeprivation account says, death is bad for you insofar as, or it's bad\nfor you when, by virtue of dying now, what you've been deprived of is,\nanother chunk of life that would've been good for you to have. And what\nwe now see is that--to see whether that could be the case or not, we've\ngot to get clear in our own minds about whether we believe in a neutral\ncontainer theory, a positive, valuable container theory or--and among\nthose, between a fantastic and a modest container theory.\n\nIf we are neutralists, we're going to say, the question is, what\nwould the contents of my life have been, for the next year, ten years,\nwhatever? If that would've been worth having, then--if the next chunk\nof my life would've been worth having--then it's bad for me that I die\nnow instead of living for the next ten years. On the other hand, if the\nbalance from here on out would've been negative, then it's good for me\nthat I died now instead of being kept alive with a life not worth\nliving. That's how the neutralists put it.\n\nIf we are valuable container theorists, we think the answer\nhas got to be, well, look at the contents, but don't forget to add some\nextra points, even if the next five years for you would've been, in\nterms of the contents, modestly bad--perhaps the value of at least\nbeing alive at all outweighs it, so it still would've been better for\nyou to be alive. But if the contents get bad enough, then you'd be\nbetter off dead.\n\nNotice that on the modest view, if we ask ourselves, would it have\nbeen good to be immortal? the answer's going to depend on not just\nwhether we accept Bernard Williams' claim that immortality would be bad\nfor you, because we now realize that what Williams was talking about\nwas the contents of an immortal life. And that's no longer an\nadequate view, or at least it's no longer a complete story, if we are\nvaluable container theorists. We could say--you could imagine somebody\nsaying, \"Oh yes, you're right, Williams, the contents get negative, but\nthat's still outweighed by the mere fact that you're alive. So on\nbalance, being immortal is a good thing.\" Whether that's right or not\ndepends on just how bad would it be to be immortal. Because, of course,\nif you're a modest, if you accept the modest version of the valuable\ncontainer theory, then if the contents get bad enough, that can\noutweigh the positive value of life.\n\nAgainst that, fans of the fantastic valuable container theory can\nsay, it doesn't really matter whether Williams is right. Even if being\nimmortal would become horrendously boring and tedious or worse, it\ndoesn't matter. The value of being alive per se outweighs that. So\nyou're always better off being alive. So more life would always be\nbetter, no matter how horrible the contents might be. So being immortal\nreally would be a good thing for you. Death always is a\nbad thing. That's what you can say if you accept the fantastic\ncontainer theory. I don't find the fantastic container theory myself--I\ndon't find it particularly attractive. I'm inclined to think not only\nthat--not only that the contents of life would be bad, eventually, for\nall of us if we were immortal--but that it would be bad enough to\noutweigh whatever value, whatever positive value being alive per se may\nhave for us. So, I'm inclined to think, eventually immortality would\nalways be bad overall.\n\nBut let me remind you that saying that does not rule out the\npossibility of consistently going on to say that even though it's a\ngood thing that we die, because eventually immortality would be\nhorrible--for all that, death could still come too soon. It\ncould still be the case that we die before life has turned bad. We die\nwhile it's still the case that living another ten years or twenty\nyears--or for that matter five hundred years--would still or could\nstill have been good for us. It's compatible with thinking that\nimmortality would be bad to think that in fact death comes too\nsoon.\n\nBut of course, we now have a return of the division between\nmoderates, optimists and pessimists. You might say, optimists are\nthose--now in this more chastened version of optimism, optimists say,\n\"Even if immortality would be bad eventually after a million years or\nten million years or what have you, the next chunk of life would've\nbeen good for all of us.\" So that death--they're optimists in this\nstrange sense, if they think life would've been good, which means of\ncourse that that we die is bad for us. Because we all die too\nsoon. That's what the optimists might say. Against that, the pessimists\nmight say, \"Boy, death comes not a moment too soon for any of us. The\nnext chunk of life is always not worth having, always worse than\nnothing.\" And in between these two extremes are the moderates, who say,\n\"For some of us, death comes too soon. For some of us, death does not\ncome too soon.\"\n\nThere's a quote I want to read. It's actually out of place now. I\nshould have read it a lecture or two ago when I started talking about\nimmortality, but I misplaced it. So, I found it this morning. So before\nI just leave the subject of immortality, let me conclude with some\nwords of wisdom from a former Miss USA contestant. She was asked the\nquestion, \"Would you want to live forever?\" And she responded, \"I would\nnot live forever, because we should not live forever. Because if we\nwere supposed to live forever, then we would live forever. But we\ncannot live forever, which is why I would not live forever.\" Isn't that\nnice? All right.\n\nSo I've been talking for, actually now a couple of weeks I suppose,\nabout the central badness of death. Why is it that death is bad for me?\nAnd the answer I propose is the deprivation account. The central bad\nthing about the fact that I'm going to die is the fact that because\nI'll be dead I'll be deprived of the good things in life. And we've now\nseen that that's a bit crude, right? We have to not talk--just talk\nabout the good things in the life, but the good of life itself, and we\nhave to notice that perhaps on certain views, for certain cases, it's\nnot really the case that when I die I'm being deprived of a good life.\nBecause the next chunk, or perhaps from there on out, it would've been\nbad. But still, details and complications of the sort we've been\nconsidering aside, the fundamental badness of death is that it deprives\nme of life worth having.\n\nBut although I've been at pains to say this is the\nfundamental bad thing about death, I think it's arguable that--I\nthink one could make the case that this isn't the only bad thing about\ndeath, even if we're focusing on why is death bad for me? There are\nother features of death, as we experience it, that are separable\nfrom the deprivation account, that at least add to the way that death\noccurs for us, where we then have to ask the question, does this add to\nthe badness of death? Or conceivably for some of these things, perhaps\nit mitigates it; it minimizes it in one way or another.\n\nSo, what I want to do is take at least a couple of minutes and\npursue some of these extra features as well. Here's an example. It's\nnot merely the fact--it's not merely true that you're going to die.\nIt's inevitable that you're going to die. There's no avoiding\nthe fact that you're going to die. I mean look, you're all going to\ncollege, but it wasn't inevitable that you go to college. Had you\nchosen not to, you could've avoided going to college. But it doesn't\nmatter what you choose, you can't avoid dying. So it's not just merely\nthe case that in fact we are all going to die; it's a necessary\ntruth that we're all going to die. So we might ask, what about this\ninevitability of death? Does that make things worse? And here I want to\ndistinguish between the individual question about the inevitability of\ndeath, and the universal question.\n\nSo just start by thinking about the fact that it's unavoidable that\nyou're going to die. Does the unavoidability of death make it\nbetter or worse? And the interesting thing is, I think you can see--you\ncan get a feel for both possible answers here. On the one hand, you can\nimagine somebody who says, \"Look, it's bad enough that I'm going to\ndie, but the fact that there's nothing I could do about it just makes\nit worse. It's like adding insult to injury that I'm powerless in the\nface of death. I cannot escape the Grim Reaper. This sheer\npowerlessness about this central fact about the nature of my existence\nis an extra insult added to the injury.\"\n\nAgainst that, however, there are those people who'd want to say,\n\"No. Actually, the inevitability of my death reduces the\nbadness.\" You all know the expression, \"Don't cry over spilt milk.\"\nRight? That what's done is done. You can't change it. What you can't\nchange, loses--when you focus on the fact that you can't change it, it\nloses some of its grip to upset you. Well, if that's right, and if we\nthen realize that there's nothing I can do about the fact that I'm\ngoing to die, then perhaps some of the sting, some of the bite, is\neliminated. It's as though you try--try getting upset about the fact\nthat two plus two equals four. Try feeling upset at your powerlessness\nto change the fact that two plus two equals four. Suppose you wanted\ntwo plus two to equal five. Can you work up anger and regret and dismay\nover that? Well, most of us, of course, can't. Because when we see that\nsomething is just necessary, we--it reduces the sting of it.\n\nThe philosopher Spinoza thought that if we could only recognize the\nfact, what he at least took to be the fact, that everything that\nhappens in life is necessary, then we'd get a kind of emotional\ndistance from it; it would no longer upset us. We could no longer be\ndisappointed, because to be disappointed in something presupposes that\nit could've been some other way. And Spinoza thought if you see that it\ncouldn't go any other way, then you can't be sad about it. Well, if we\nsee that our death is inevitable and we really internalize that fact,\nperhaps that would reduce the badness of it.\n\nWell, maybe that's right, but going back to the firsthand, I don't\nknow how many of you have read Dostoyevsky's short novel The\nUnderground Man. The Underground Man is upset about--if I remember\ncorrectly--he's upset about the fact that two plus two equals four and\nthere's nothing that he can do about it. So he curses existence, curses\nGod at having made him so impotent that he can't change the fact that\ntwo plus two equals four. And another philosopher, Descartes, in\nthinking about God's omnipotence, thought that it wouldn't be good\nenough if God as omnipotent couldn't change the facts of mathematics.\nAnd so he imagines that God, as omnipotent, could've made two plus two\nequals five. And so it's a kind of--;So, it is indeed a fact of our\npowerlessness that we're stuck with the necessities. God isn't stuck\nwith them. And so Dostoyevsky takes that thought and runs with it and\nsays, \"Yeah. It doesn't help to say that it's inevitable. It makes it\nworse.\" Well, there's both sides. And as I say, I myself, in different\nmoods, get pulled in both ways.\n\nWhat about the fact that not only is it inevitable that I'm going to\ndie, it's inevitable that we're all going to die. Does the\nuniversality of death make things better or worse? And again,\nyou can sort of feel the pull both ways. On the one hand you say, it's\nbad that I'm going to die, but I'm not a monster. It makes me\nfeel even worse that everybody else is stuck dying--or perhaps\nwe should say dying too soon in light of our discussion about\nimmortality. It's a pity that most everybody, or perhaps everybody,\ndies too soon. That makes it even worse.\n\nOn the other hand, you know, let's be honest here, we also know the\nexpression, \"Misery loves company.\" And there's at least some comfort\nto be had, isn't there, in the realization that this thing isn't just\ntrue for me. It's not like the universe has singled me out for the\ndeprivation of dying too soon. It's something that it does to\neverybody. So perhaps there's some comfort in the inevitability of\ndeath.\n\nWell, here's a different aspect of death worth thinking about. What\nabout the variability of death? After all, it's not just the\ncase that we all die. And I'll stop saying die too soon. Let's just\nsuppose we understand that clause to be implied in what I'm saying.\nIt's not just the case that we all die. There's a great deal of\nvariation in how much life we get. Some of us make it to the\nripe old age of 80, 90 a 100 or more. Others of us die at 20, or 15, or\n10, or younger.\n\nEven if death were inevitable, it wouldn't have to come in\ndifferent-sized packages. That is, it wouldn't have to have\nvariability. We could imagine a world in which everybody\ndies--everybody dies at the age of a hundred. Does it make things worse\nor better that there's this kind of variability? From the moral point\nof view, I suppose, it's fairly straightforward to suggest it makes\nthings worse. After all, most of us are inclined to think that\ninequality is morally objectionable. It's bad that, through no fault of\ntheir own, some people are poor and other people are rich. If\ninequality is morally objectionable, then it's very likely we're going\nto think it's morally horrendous that there's this crucial inequality:\nsome of us die a the age of 5 while others get to live to 90.\n\nBut in keeping with the focus of our discussion about the badness of\ndeath, I want to put aside the moral question and think about how good\nor bad for me is it that there's variability in death? Well, we\nmight say, let's look at it from two basic perspectives, those who get\nless than the average lifespan and those who get more than the average\nlifespan. From the point of view of somebody who gets less, this\nis obviously a bad thing. It's bad enough that I'm going to die too\nsoon. I said I wasn't going to keep saying that remark, and here I am\nsaying it anyway. It's bad enough that I'm going to die. But what's\neven worse is I'm going to get even less than the average amount of\nlife. That's clearly an extra-bad. But we might then wonder, for every\nperson who gets less than the average amount of life--suppose we take\nthe median, take the amount of life that's exactly, 50 percent of the\npeople get more, 50 percent of the people get less. For every person\nwho has less than the median amount of life, there's another person who\nhas more than the median amount of life. That person gets to\nsay, hey. Well, you know, it's a pity that I'm going to die or die too\nsoon, but at least I'm getting more than the average. That's a\nplus.\n\nSo perhaps these two aspects balance themselves out. There are\npeople who are basically screwed by the fact that they get less than\nthe average amount and people who are benefited by getting more than\nthe average amount. So perhaps in terms of the individual badness of\ndeath that's a wash. Maybe. Except it seems to me it's a further fact\nabout human psychology that we care more about being short-changed than\nwe do about being, as we might put it, overcompensated. I rather\nsuspect that people who have less than the average of something, it\nhurts them more than it benefits the people who have more than the\naverage of something. And if that's right--and that seems likely to be\nthe case, especially for something like death--the extra bad of the\nfact that there's variability and so some people get less than\naverage--that extra bad, I suspect, outweighs the extra benefit of some\npeople having more than average.\n\nWell, let's consider a different feature. We've had inevitability;\nwe had variability. What about unpredictability? Not only is it\ninevitable that you're going to die; not only do some people live\nlonger than others, you don't know how much more time you've got. Now,\nyou might think, well, didn't we already discuss that when we started\nthinking about variability? But in fact, logically speaking at least,\nvariability, although it's a requirement for unpredictability, doesn't\nguarantee unpredictability. You could have variability with complete\npredictability. Imagine that when everybody's born, on their wrist\neverybody's born with a natural birthmark that indicates the precise\nyear, day, and time in which they're going to die. We could imagine a\nworld like this where it's inevitable; everybody's got some date on it.\nAnd for that matter, there could still be variability. Some people live\n80 years, some people live 20 years. But there's no unpredictability.\nBecause of the birthmark, everybody knows exactly how much longer\nthey've got.\n\nWell, so in our world we don't have that. In our world, not only do\nwe have variability, we've got unpredictability. Does that make things\nbetter? Or does that make things worse? Would it be better to know when\nyou were going to die? Well, one way in which unpredictability at least\nhas the potential of making things worse is this. Because you don't\nknow how much more time you've got--You can make a guess based on\nstatistics, but as we saw, there's wild unpredictability. You can\nthink, look, \"the average lifespan in the United States is whatever it\nis, 82 years. So I probably have, you guys are in your 20s--you know\n20--roughly another 60 years are going.\" And as you're busy calculating\nall this, you're walking across Chapel Street and you get hit by a\ntruck and you die. Right? Because of unpredictability, you can't really\nknow. And because you can't really know, it's difficult to make the\nright kinds of plans.\n\nAnd in particular, it's hard to know how to pace yourself. You\ndecide to go off to medical school, become a doctor. And so not only do\nyou put the time into college, you put the time into medical school,\nand you put the time into your residency and you put your time into\nyour internship. And that's a very long commitment. It's a long-term\nplan, which can go wrong if you get sick and die in your early 20s.\nWell, that's a rather dramatic example, but the same sort of thing in\nprinciple can happen to all of us. You make a life plan, what you want\nto accomplish in your life, and well, obviously enough, some of us will\ndie too soon, not just in terms of, \"oh, well, life still could've had\ngood things,\" but too soon in terms of you didn't get where you wanted\nto get in terms of your life plan. If only you'd known you were only\ngoing to have 20 more years instead of 50 more years, you would've\npicked a different kind of life for yourself. The unpredictability\nmakes it worse.\n\nAnd indeed, less obviously, it can work the other way as well. You\nmake a life plan, and then, you know, you don't die yet. You continue\nto stick around, and then your life has this feeling of--at least we\ncan imagine this happening--being sort of anticlimactic. You peaked too\nsoon. If only you'd known you had another 50 years, that you weren't\ngoing to die young--or James Dean, going to burn out fast and die\nyoung--if only you'd realized you were going to live to the ripe old\nage of 97, you would have picked a different life for yourself.\n\nNow, in thinking about these points, in effect I'm suggesting that\nthe value of your life--so ,we previously were talking about different\ntheories of well-being and what makes for the best kind of life. Here\nwe have yet another kind of feature that we haven't talked about. We\nmight think of it as, the overall shape of your life matters. What we\ncould also call \"the narrative arc of your life\" matters.\n\nLet me illustrate the point with some very, very simple graphs.\nThese are not meant to be realistic, but they'll give you the idea. So,\nwe all know the Horatio Alger story right? Somebody starts out poor and\nmakes his way through hard work and dedication and effort to riches and\nsuccess. Rags to riches--that's a wonderful, inspiring life.\n\nLet's draw the graph of that life. So here's how well off you are,\nhere is time, and you start with nothing and you end up incredibly well\noff. That's a great life. That's the Horatio Alger life--H.A. Great\nlife. All right. Now, consider the following story. Here are the axes\nagain. Instead of the rags to riches life, imagine the riches to rags\nlife. Starts off with everything, ends up with nothing. That's the\nAlgers Horatio story. It's the reverse. [See Figure 20.1] Now, I doubt\nif there's anybody here who is indifferent between the choices,\nindifferent with regard to the choice between these two lives. I\nimagine that everybody here prefers this life.\n\nBut notice that in terms of the contents of the life, at least the\nlocal contents, it's a bit hard to see why that would be the case,\nright? We've got equal periods of suffering and doing slightly better\nand slightly better and slightly better--equal periods of success and\nsuffering. For every bad period here there's a corresponding bad period\nhere. For every good period here there's a corresponding good period\nhere. In terms of the contents of your life, being crude but you see\nthe point, in terms of the contents of your life--equally good. And\neven if we accept the valuable container theory, and so we say, \"Hah,\nyou know, being alive per se is worth something as well.\" Well, you're\nalive for equal periods of time. So the extra points get added either\nway.\n\nYou might say, look, if we're not indifferent between these two\nlives, that's because we think the overall shape of your life matters\nas well. The narrative arc, as I put it. The story \"bad to good\" is the\nkind of story we want for ourselves, while the story \"good to bad\" is\nthe kind of story we don't want for ourselves. Interesting question.\nWhy is that? And this of course should remind us of the puzzle about\nLucretius. Why do we care more about future non-existence than past\nnon-existence? When the bad is behind us, that seems less bothersome\nthan when the bad is in front of us.\n\nYou may remember the story from Derek Parfit about having the\npainful operation. Was it going to be in the future or did it take\nplace earlier today? You don't remember. We're not indifferent. We want\nthe bad behind us, not the bad in front of us. So, whatever the\nexplanation is, we care about the overall shape and trajectory of our\nlife.\n\nNow, that being the case, we have to worry then that because of the\nunpredictability of death that our lives may not have the ideal shape.\nA lot of us might feel that a life like this, where we peak but then we\nstick around--you know, isn't--can at least fail to be as desirable in\nwhich we end with a bang. [See Figure 20.2] If you start thinking about\nnarrative arcs--imagine a novel, right? It's one thing to have--it's\nnot to say that the best--if you want your life to be like the plot of\na great story, it's not as though you think, \"All right, the d√©nouement\nmust occur at the very last page.\" It's okay to stick around for a\nwhile, but if the high point of the story occurs in chapter 2 and then\nthere are another 67 chapters after that, you think, this was not a\nwell-constructed novel.\n\nAnd insofar as we care about the overall shape of our lives, we\nmight worry about wanting it to have the right shape overall. Where and\nwhen do you want to peak, as it were, in terms of your accomplishments?\nWell, that matters to us, but the trouble is, without predictability\nyou don't know where to put the peak. Because if you try to aim for\npeaking later, you might not make it to that. If you put it too soon,\nyou might stick around for longer than that, and then the peak has come\ntoo soon. All of this suggests then that the unpredictability of our\ndeath adds an extra negative element. It makes it harder to plan what\nthe best way to live my life would be. And from that perspective it\nlooks as though it would be better to know how much time you've got\nleft. But then we have to ask--so I'll throw the question out and we'll\ncall it a day, start with this next time--then we have to ask, would it\nreally be better to know? Would you want the birthmark? Would you want\nto know exactly how much time you've got left? All Right. See you next\ntime.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct21.html":{"url":"lct21.html","title":"Lecture 21","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 21 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nApril 10, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: All right. Last time we started\nasking ourselves about what are some of the other aspects of death that\nmight contribute to its badness, or at least other features of death\nthat are worth thinking about. Conceivably, some of them might reduce\nthe badness of death, in some way. We talked about the inevitability of\ndeath; we talked about the variability, that people have different\nlengths of time before they die. And we turned to a discussion of the\nunpredictability of death, the fact that because we don't know--we\ncan't predict--how much more time we've got, we may, as it were, pace\nourselves incorrectly. You may take on a long-term project and then die\nbefore you've been able to complete it; or alternatively, you may peak\ntoo soon and then continue to stick around in an anti-climactic way.\nThese are bads of life that could presumably be avoided if only we knew\nhow much exactly we had--how much longer we had.\n\nOn the other hand, we have to ask ourselves--and this the question\nthat I left us with last time--whether it would really, all things\nconsidered, be better to know how much time you had. After all, if you\nknew--suppose we had the birthmarks that told you when you were going\nto die--if you had that kind of a birthmark, you would face your entire\nlife with the burden of knowing, I've got 48 years left, 47 years left,\n50 years left. I should've been counting down--35, 30, 25 and so forth.\nMany of us would find that was, as I say, a burden--something hanging\nconstantly over us interfering with our ability to enjoy life.\n\nSuppose that there were some sort of genetic marker and, although we\ndidn't have a tattoo that you would just have to look at, but you could\nhave genetic counseling--have your DNA examined and you could tell, if\nyou had the DNA testing, how much time you had left. Would you want to\nget that testing done? Now, that's of course science fiction, and I\npresume it's going to stay science fiction--though we're on the cusp of\nhaving something at least approximating that as we learn more and more\nabout the various genes that carry various diseases, we--more and more\nof us face the question of whether or not we want to get tested for\nthose diseases.\n\nSuppose there was a test. Indeed, one occasionally reads in the\nnewspaper about this sort of thing where you can get tested for such\nand such a disease. You might know already that you've got a 50 percent\nchance of having it, but you don't know whether you yourself have it.\nIf you do have it, the disease will always have onset by age 40, 50 or\nwhat have you. Would you want to have that kind of information? Closely\nrelated question. If you did know how much time you had left, how would\nyou act differently from what you're doing now? Would it focus your\nattention on making sure you did the things that were most important to\nyou? And it's worth--;it's sort of a useful test for asking yourself\nwhat are the things you must value in life--to ask, what would you\nchoose to do if you knew you had five years, ten years, what have\nyou?\n\nThere's an old Saturday Night Live routine where one of the\nactors is in the doctor's office, and the doctor gives him the very sad\nnews that he's got two minutes left to live. And he says, \"I'm going to\npack a lifetime of enjoyment into those two minutes.\" And then of\ncourse, the point of the skit is he presses the down button on the\nelevator and a minute and a half goes by while he's waiting for the\nelevator to come.\n\nIf you knew you had a year left or two years left, what would you do\nwith that time? Would you be in school? Would you travel? Would you\nspend more time hanging out with your friends? A very, for me,\nextremely striking example of this question occurred in this very\nclass. There was a student in this class some years ago who was dying.\nAnd he knew that he was dying. He'd been diagnosed with, if I recall\ncorrectly, cancer as a freshmen--and his doctor had told him that he\npretty much had no chance of recovery and indeed had only a couple more\nyears to live. Faced with that question, he had to ask himself, \"Well,\nwhat should I do with my remaining years?\" It was astonishing enough\nthat somebody--but perhaps understandable--that somebody in that\nsituation would decide to take a class on death and then have himself,\nsubmit himself, to my getting up here week after week, talking about\nhow there's no soul, there's no prospect for an afterlife, it's a good\nthing that we're all going to die.\n\nBut faced with the question what should he do, what did he want to\ndo with his remaining couple of years, what he decided he wanted to do\nwas finish his Yale degree--thought he'd set himself the goal of\ngraduating college before he died. And he was taking this class second\nsemester of his senior year. At least, he was taking it until Spring\nBreak. By Spring Break he'd gotten sufficiently sick that his doctor\nbasically said, \"You can't continue in school anymore. You've got to go\nhome.\" Basically, \"You've got to go home to die.\" And indeed, he got\nprogressively and then rapidly deteriorated at that point. The faculty\nmembers who were teaching his classes that semester then all faced the\nquestion posed to them by the administration, based on the work he's\ndone so far this semester, has he--what kind of grade are you prepared\nto give him? Because, depending on which of his classes he passed and\nwhich of his classes he failed, the question was going to be,was he\ngoing to graduate or not? In fact, of course, he did manage to\ngraduate. And Yale, to its, I think, real glory and credit sent a\nmember of the administration down to his deathbed to award him his\ndegree before he passed away.\n\nSo, as I say, it's a very striking story. I'm not sure how many of\nus would decide the last thing we wanted to do with our remaining years\nis to spend it in college. Well, what is it that you'd want to\ndo? And again, to move back and ask ourselves a larger question, would\nknowing how much time you have be something that would allow you to\nactually embrace those choices, or would it instead just be a burden?\nThat's the kind of question we have to face when we think about the\nfact that we don't know how much time we've got. Is that something that\nincreases the badness of death, or does it reduce its significance\nsomewhat?\n\nHere's another feature. In addition to the inevitability, in\naddition to the variability, in addition to the unpredictability,\nthere's the fact that death is, as I like to think of it,\nubiquitous. I don't just mean the fact that people are dying all\naround us, but I mean rather, you yourself could die at any time.\nThere's never any getting away from the possibility that you'll die\nnow. Even if we didn't have unpredictability, I mean rather, even if we\nhad unpredictability, it wouldn't necessarily follow that death was\npervasive in this way. The point I've got in mind here is this--even\nwhen you think you're perfectly safe, you could of course die of a\nstroke. You could die of a heart attack. Even somebody who's young\ncould have an aneurysm.\n\nOr one of my favorite examples, you could be sitting in your--you\nread this sort of thing in the newspaper periodically--you could be\nsitting in your living room when suddenly an airplane crashes into your\nhouse, killing you. These sorts of things happen. You thought you were\nsafe. You were watching reruns on television--the next minute, you're\ndead. The fact that you could die and you don't know when you're going\nto die doesn't yet entail that you could die at any minute, at any\nmoment. But in fact, that's true of us as well.\n\nYet another example close to heart. I remember--before I taught here\nI used to teach at the University of Illinois at Chicago. And once I\nwas driving down the highway and a car pulled in without looking and\nclipped my car, and caused my car--you know, so pulled in from the\nentrance--caused my car to go careening across three lanes of traffic\nspinning out of control. And I remember quite clearly thinking to\nmyself as that happened--the whole thing lasted only a few moments--but\nI remember thinking quite clearly, \"I'm going to die.\" Now, as it\nhappens, I didn't die. I walked away from the accident, and the damage\nto my car was rather minimal. But it could've have happened like\nthat.\n\nDeath is--the possibility of death--is ubiquitous. It's pervasive.\nWe have to ask ourselves then, does this make things worse? It\ncertainly feels, to my mind, as though it's an extra bad about the\nnature of death. It would be nice to get a breather. Imagine, if you\nwill, that there were certain locations, certain vacation spots, where\nas long as you were there you couldn't die. Wouldn't it be nice to be\nable to go someplace and just for a period think to yourself, \"Well,\nyou know, right now I don't have to worry about that. It doesn't even\nhave to cross my mind.\"\n\nMaybe if there were these sort of death-free zones, they'd get\nrather crowded. So perhaps we should change the example. Instead of\nhaving death-free zones, imagine that there were death-free times. Just\nsuppose, for whatever reason, nobody could die between twelve and one.\nYou could just put it out of your mind. Wouldn't that be nice? All\nright, one o'clock, you take the mantle back on. But wouldn't it be\nnice to just have a certain period of time every day when you didn't\nhave to even have it be so much as a remote possibility? Or suppose\nthere were certain death-free activities. Maybe reading philosophy\nwould be something that as long as you were doing it you couldn't die\nor, as perhaps some religious traditions might've taught, as long as\nyou were engaged in prayer you couldn't die. Wouldn't that be nice?\n\nOr turn the entire thing the other way around. Suppose that most\ntimes and most activities were death free, but certain activities\nintroduce the possibility of dying. So you couldn't die unless you were\nengaged in certain activities. So you would be immortal but not in the\nsense of immortal against your will. There'd be certain activities\nperhaps, for example putting a gun to your head, that would put an end\nto your life. So even if immortality would be bad, there would be\ncertain things you could do that could end it. Ask yourself, what sorts\nof activities would you engage in if you knew that those activities\ncarried with them the risk of dying?\n\nSo most of the time you couldn't die. What things would be so\nimportant to you that you'd be willing to suddenly risk death for the\nsake of doing those things? You like art. Is art important enough to\nyou that you'd be prepared to watch, look at a masterpiece, if you knew\nthat while you were enjoying it you could die, but that wouldn't happen\notherwise? Is sex great enough that you'd be prepared to run the risk\nof dying while you were engaged in sex? Again, it's a nice lens for\nasking yourself, what are the things that are most valuable to you? by\nasking, which of them are so valuable you'd be prepared to do them even\nif they would introduce what isn't otherwise there, namely, the risk of\ndeath?\n\nNow, in the posing the question that way, I've been assuming that\nthese are things you'd do despite the fact that they run the\nrisk of death. I suppose there's a further question we have to ask, are\nthere things that would be worth doing precisely because of the\nfact that they introduced the risk of death? Now, I've got to admit\nthat when I pose that question, that sounds rather bizarre. At least,\nputting aside the possibility that we've now lived our hundred thousand\nyears and have exhausted all that life's got to offer for us, certainly\nto engage in activities now, while life still has so much more to\noffer--to engage in activities now where, precisely for the\nchance of dying, that strikes me as bizarre. And yet, it seems to me\nthat there are many activities, and if not many at least several\nactivities, that people do precisely for that reason.\n\nFor example, let me tell you something I know that's going to shock\nyou. Did you know there are people who jump out of airplanes? Now,\nadmittedly they've got this little piece of cloth that gives them a\ndecent chance of not killing themselves when they jump out of\nairplanes. But these things do fail. Every now and then you read in the\nnewspaper about somebody whose parachute failed to open and so they\ndied. And I ask myself, why? What could possibly drive somebody to jump\nout of an airplane with nothing but a little piece of cloth between\nthem and death? And the answer that strikes me as most plausible is,\nit's the very fact that there's a significant chance of death that\nhelps explain why people do this.\n\nNow, I know if you talk to some of these people, they'll often say,\n\"Oh, no, no, no. The views are so glorious,\" or something like that.\nBut I think this is rather an implausible suggestion because, of\ncourse, you could have these glorious views just by going up in the\nairplane and looking down from the safety of your airplane. Part of the\nthrill has got to be--or so it seems to me--part of the thrill has got\nto be the very fact that they now have an increased risk of death. The\nchance of dying is part of what drives somebody to jump out of an\nairplane.\n\nWell, if that's right, then should we say that the pervasiveness of\ndeath, ubiquitousness of death--the thing that I was earlier suggesting\nwas oppressive--wouldn't it really be nice to have a death-free time or\na death-free location or death-free activities? Maybe I was wrong in\nsuggesting that. If the chance of death would add a kind of zest, then\nperhaps the ubiquity of death is actually a good thing rather\nthan a bad thing.\n\nWell, I'm inclined to think, at least in my own case, that that's\nnot right. And perhaps the explanation has got to be the ubiquity of\ndeath is this kind of background, constant hum. And the fact that we're\nalways facing some risk of death recedes into the background in the way\nthat most of us don't hear background noise--that what jumping out of\nan airplane does for you is it spikes the risk of death. So, it's not\nreally good enough to just have some risk of death--it's got to\nbe greater risk than usual. If that's right, if that's the psychology,\nthen even for those death thrill seekers, the ubiquity of death won't\nnecessarily be a good thing because of it being constant. It just\nrecedes into the background.\n\nAll right. So again, what I've been asking us to think about are\nvarious aspects of death that might contribute to either increase or\nperhaps in certain ways reduce somewhat the badness of death. There's\none more aspect that I want to take a couple of minutes and have us\nthink about, and that's this. Previously to this most recent\ndiscussion, I talked about the value of life. Some rival theories about\nwhat makes life worth living. And for the last lecture or so I've been\ntalking about, in addition to the deprivation account, the additional\nthings that contribute to the badness of death.\n\nSo you might think, well, what about the human condition as a whole?\nWhat about the fact that it's not just that we live, or for that matter\nit's not just that we die. What's true about humans is that we live and\nthen we die. That's the human condition--life followed by death.\nYou might ask, what's the value of that entire combination?\n\nNow, the most natural thing to suggest would be, well, you get clear\non your favorite theory about the value of life, whatever that is. You\nget clear about the kinds of questions we've just been asking about the\nbadness of death, whatever that is. What's the overall assessment of\nthe human condition? You might think, well, that's just a matter of\nadding up the goodness of life and subtracting the badness of death and\nsumming whatever it comes to.\n\nI suppose, again, the optimist says, \"Yeah, death is bad, but life\nis good, sufficiently good to outweigh the badness of the fact that\nwe're going to die. On balance, it's a good thing to be born.\" And\npessimists might be those who say, \"No, no. On balance, the negative of\ndeath outweighs the positive-ness of life.\"\n\nBut I want to pause for a moment and note that this assumption that\nthe way to think about the value of the combination as just a matter of\nadding the goodness of life and the badness of death and just summing\nthem that way--that may not be right. Because sometimes the value of a\ncombination is different than the value you would get by just thinking\nabout each one of the parts in isolation and then adding them up. A\nkind of addition approach to values of wholes may not always be\ncorrect.\n\nHere's a nice simple example to make that point. My two favorite\nfoods in the world are probably pizza on the one hand and chocolate on\nthe other. I know I've shared my love of chocolate with you before. I\ndon't recall having shared my love of pizza with you before, but there\nit is--two favorite things I love--love pizza, delicious, love\nchocolate, delicious. Take these two delicious things and combine them\ninto a chocolate covered pizza. Oh my God! The whole idea just sounds\ndisgusting. And it is, I take it, disgusting. But you wouldn't notice\nthe disgustingness if you just thought about the value of pizza in\nisolation and the value of chocolate in isolation. The value of\nchocolate-covered pizza is not just a matter of summing up the value of\nthe parts taken in isolation. You've got to think about what we might\ndub \"the interaction effects.\"\n\nSo let's ask ourselves, are there any interaction effects when we\ntalk about the human condition that it's life followed by death?\" We've\nthought about the value of life in isolation; we've been, in effect,\nthinking about the value of death in isolation. Does the fact that\ndeath follows life--does that produce any interaction effects between\nthe two, which need to be added into our formula--added into the mix as\nwell?\n\nWell, there's obviously, I suppose, two possibilities. Well, really\nthree. Possibility number one is, no it doesn't make any\ndifference--uninteresting possibility. More interestingly--two\nremaining possibilities. Yeah, there are actually some ways in which\nthe combination ends up becoming worse. The interaction effects make\nthings even worse, and we can't overlook those negative interaction\neffects. Also, the possibility that there might be some positive\ninteraction effects.\n\nLet me start briefly by mentioning a possibility for a positive\ninteraction effect. Because of the fact that you're going to die,\nobviously enough, it's not just that you'll get whatever life you get,\nbut there's a finite amount of life that you're going to get.\nLife is a scarce resource. It's precious. And we might be attracted to\nthe thought that the value of life is increased by its very\npreciousness. There's a kind of aspect of value for many of us where we\nfeel that something's especially valuable if it won't endure, if it's\nfragile, or if it's rare. This can enhance the value of something. And\nso, arguably, the fact that life is precious, that it won't endure,\ncould actually increase its value for us.\n\nThere's a short story by the science fiction writer Orson Scott\nCard, where the basic point of the story is that of all the life forms\nin the universe, we, here on Earth, are the only ones that are mortal.\nAnd because of this we are the envy of the rest of the universe. It's\nnot so much that immortality, what the rest of them have, is\nunattractive or boring. It's perfectly fine, but they envy us for our\nfinite lifespans, because what we've got and they don't have is\nsomething that's for each individual rare--something that's not\nlasting, something that's precious in that way. All right, it's a\npossibility. So, it's possible that the very fact that we're going to\ndie causes an interaction effect with our life so there's an upside to\nit. It makes our life fragile, ephemeral, and as a result of that, more\nprecious.\n\nBut it's also possible--actually compatible with accepting that\nfact--there are two additional possibilities, that there might be some\nnegative interaction effects. It could be that in thinking about\nthe nature of the combination we're led to see that in certain ways the\ncombination--the interaction effects--are negative, are bad ones. Well,\nhere are two possibilities for that thought. First possibility I think\nof under the heading \"A Taste is Just a Tease.\" It's as though we live\nlife for a while, getting a feel for all the wonderful things life\ncould offer us, and then a moment later, as it were, it's snatched away\nfrom us. It's sort of adding insult to injury that we're offered just a\nwhiff. It's as though somebody brought in this delicious meal to a\nhungry--before a hungry person--allowed them to see what it looked\nlike, allowed them to smell the delicious aromas, perhaps gave them\njust one little tiny forkful to see just how beautifully delicious the\nfood was. And then they snatched the whole thing away.\n\nYou can imagine somebody who says, \"Look, it would be better never\nto have had the taste at all than to have the taste and then not be\nallowed to have the entire meal.\" That's something that you might not\nnotice if you just focus on the intrinsic nature of the taste. After\nall, the intrinsic nature of the taste was positive. Or, if you just\nfocused on the intrinsic character of the not-having the meal. After\nall, not having the meal is just an absence of a certain experience. To\ncapture what's excruciatingly undesirable about the two, you need to\nthink about the two in combination. It's an interaction effect. And we\nmight think, look, this is one of the negative things about the human\ncondition that we get a taste of life--nothing more--before it's\nsnatched away. That's one possibility.\n\nThe second possible thought that comes to mind for me, in thinking\nabout the negative interaction effects, I call under the title--I think\nabout under the title--\"How the Noble Have Fallen.\" Right now, there's\nsomething amazing about us. We are people. In the universe we--Who\nknows what is out there in the universe but at least on Earth we may\nwell be the only people there are. Now, who knows? Maybe dolphins or\ncertain--some of the great apes. But at any rate, it's a rather select\nclub. We are, as I said, early in the semester when I said I'm a\nphysicalist, I believe that people are just machines, but we're not\njust any old machine. We're amazing machines. We're able to love. We're\nable to write poetry. We're able to think about the farthest reaches of\nthe universe and ask what our place is in the universe. People are\namazing. And we end up rotting. We end up corpses.\n\nThere's something--For many of us, there's something horrifying\nabout the thought that something as amazing as us, as exalted and\nvaluable as us, could end up something as lowly and unimportant as a\npiece of rotting flesh. Again, think about it. The image here that\ncomes to mind for me is one of these deposed kings who ends up waiting\non tables to make a living in New York. And it's--you might think, \"All\nright. The life of a waiter is not the worst thing in the world.\" But\nthere's extra, again, insult to injury, when the person's got to\nremember that he used to be something extraordinary, a ruler.\n\nAgain, if you just thought about life as a ruler, well pretty good\nthinking about it in isolation. Life as a waiter, not so bad thinking\nabout it in isolation. To see the nature of the problem you've got to\nthink about the fact that it's a combination package. There is\nsomething especially insulting about having gone from king to waiter.\nHow the mighty have fallen. And that fate is waiting for all of us.\nIt's a fact about the human condition that the amazing things we are\ndon't stay amazing. We turn into pieces of rotting flesh, decaying.\n\nSo two possible negative effects--the taste is just a tease, the how\nthe noble have fallen--on the one hand. One possible positive effect,\nthe extra preciousness of life. I'm not quite sure where, on balance,\nwe should say how these things play out.\n\nAgain, I suppose we could have different views. On the one hand, the\noptimists might say, \"Even when we throw in the extra interaction\neffects, even the negative interaction effects, the overall nature of\nthe human condition is positive. So that it's a good thing to be born,\neven though your life is going to be followed by death.\" And against\nthat, we could have the pessimists who say, \"The negative side,\nespecially once we throw in the negative interaction effects, the\nnegative side is so great that it would be better never to have been\nborn at all.\" That's the pessimist view. Given that we're going to die,\nthis fact seeps back in and poisons the nature of life or perhaps\npoisons the nature of the whole, life followed by death, so that on\nbalance the whole thing's negative. Better to have not had any of it,\nbetter to have not been born at all, say the pessimists, than to have\nthis combination package of life followed by death.\n\nNow, for myself, I'm sufficiently optimistic that I'm inclined to\nthink life's wonderful. The negative combination effects that I was\ntalking about are certainly there, but on balance I think the human\ncondition for must of us is a good one. It's better to have been born\nthan never to--even though that's followed by death--than never to have\nbeen born at all.\n\nBut I do want to emphasize the point that even if we were to accept\nthe pessimist's conclusion that it would be better never to have been\nborn at all, it doesn't follow, at least doesn't follow without further\nargument, that the right response to the realization--if it is the\ncorrect realization that it would be better never to have been born at\nall--doesn't follow that the right response is to commit suicide.\n\nIt's a tempting thought right? To go philosophically from life's so\nbad given the nature of the human condition, life followed by death,\nthat better to never have had any of it than to have just had a taste\nand a tease and so forth. But it's a tempting philosophical thought to\nsay, \"Once I've shown it's better never to have been born, it follows\nthat suicide is the appropriate response.\" But in fact, as a matter of\nlogic, that doesn't follow at all. Because if you think about it,\nsuicide doesn't change the fundamental nature of the human condition,\nlife followed by death. It's not as though if you kill yourself you\nsomehow bring it about that you've never been born at all. It's still\nthe case that if there's something horrible about having just a\ntaste--well, indeed, if you commit suicide you've made it an even\nshorter taste. If there's something sort of degrading or unnoble about\nbeing a person who is going to become a corpse, committing suicide\ndoesn't alter that fundamental fact either. It just makes the insult\ncome sooner.\n\nSo, even if we were to agree with the pessimists that it would be\nbetter never to have been born at all, as the old joke goes, show me\none person in a thousand who's so lucky, right? We have all been born.\nAnd from the fact, even if we were to agree with it, that it would've\nbeen better if we hadn't been born--instead of feeling sorry for unborn\nLarry, perhaps we should envy unborn Larry; that's what the\npessimists say--even if that were true, it wouldn't follow that suicide\nwas an appropriate response.\n\nIt doesn't mean of course that suicide isn't ever an appropriate\nresponse. We're coming on toward the end of the semester, and the last\ntopic we'll be talking about is indeed the topic of suicide. When, if\never, is suicide an appropriate, rational or moral response to one's\nsituation? Let's hold off on thinking about that question a bit\nfurther. Before we get to suicide, you might say, the question that's\ngoing to entertain us for the remaining few weeks is this. How should\none live, in light of the facts about death that I've been laying out\nin the semester up to this point? How should we live, in light of the\nfacts about death? And one possible response, the last one we'll look\nat, is, what you should, at least sometimes, is kill yourself. We'll\ncome to that. We're going to spend the next couple of weeks asking\nourselves different aspects of the question, what should our response\nbe to the fact of our death and the specific features of death and the\nnature of death that we've been exploring?\n\nBut the very first question I suppose we really need to ask is this.\nShould we be thinking about all this at all? Well, I realize that for\nyou guys it's too late, right? It's sort of late in the day for\nstudents who have been through the better part of a semester thinking\nabout the nature of death to argue, maybe, it wasn't such a good idea\nfor you to take this class in the first place. But as theorists, we\ncould be interested in the theoretical possibility that the right\nresponse is to not think about the facts of death at all.\n\nLook, in principle I suppose there are three different reactions.\nSo, I make various claims of the sort that I've been making about,\n\"Well look, you know, we're just physical objects. When these objects\nbreak, we cease to exist. The objects don't get put back together,\" and\nso forth and so on. One possibility, of course, is simply to disagree\nwith me about the facts. And so you--of course, if you do disagree I\nthink you're mistaken, so I'll think of you as denying the facts, but\nall right, that's a possibility. Another possibility, the one I'll turn\nto a little bit later, is admit the facts and live accordingly. Of\ncourse, we haven't yet asked ourselves, how should you live if\nyou recognize and take into account those facts? That's the question\nwe'll turn to. But there's the middle possibility, which is not so much\nthink about them and deny them, not so much think about them, accept\nthem and act accordingly, but simply don't think about them. Maybe the\nbest response to the facts of death is just put it out of your mind.\nDon't give it any thought at all.\n\nNow, on the one hand you might think, that can't possibly be the\nright response, the appropriate response. After all, how can it be\nappropriate to disregard, to put out of your mind, facts? Well, that\nall sounds very nice, but I think that claim has got to just be\nmistaken. There's nothing unacceptable or inappropriate or misguided\nabout not thinking about all sorts of facts that you might have learned\nat some point or the other. Here's my favorite example of stupid facts\nI was forced to learn when I was younger--state capitals, right? I've\ngotten pretty far in my life, and as far as I can tell I've never,\never, ever had to remember the capitals of the 50 states. So, I just\ndon't think about it. Pretty much I think about it only once a year,\nwhen I'm giving this very lecture. I start asking, how many state\ncapitals can I remember? And the answer is, really not all that many of\nthem. Not thinking about those facts that I knew at one point--just not\nall that objectionable.\n\nSo, the mere fact, if it is a fact, suppose the facts about life and\ndeath are as I've described them. Until we say something more, it's not\nclear that we shouldn't just, all right, note it, store it away, and\nforget about it, just like the facts about the state capitals.\n\nThat seems odd; that seems misguided. But why? What is it about the\nfacts about life and death that seem to make it misguided to think we\nshould just put them aside and pay no attention to them? Presumably\nbecause we're led to the thought, we're attracted to the thought, that\nthe nature of death, the facts about death--whatever they are--should\nhave an impact on how we live. The appropriate way to live gets shaped,\nat least in part, by the fact that we're going to die, that we won't be\naround forever. If that's right, then it seems as though there'd be\nsomething irrational and inappropriate about simply disregarding those\nfacts.\n\nLet me tell you two stories that might--well, look, before I tell\nyou the stories here's the other side. Suppose somebody said, \"Yeah,\nit's true if I thought about the nature of death, the fact that the 50,\n80, 90 years I've got on this Earth is all I'm going to have. If I\nthought about that fact, it would just be overwhelming. It would be\ncrushing. I'd be unable to go on with my life.\" People sometimes claim\nthat that's the case and, because of that, the right thing to do is to\nnot think about it. You've read at this point, long since, Tolstoy's\nDeath of Ivan Ilych. The people in the Tolstoy story seem to\nhave put facts of mortality out of their mind. Why? Presumably because\nthey think that facing it is just too crushing and overwhelming. So the\nway they cope with it--they think the appropriate response is put it\naside, disregard the facts about death.\n\nWell, as I say, there seems to be something amiss about that\nreaction. That was certainly the point that Tolstoy was trying to get\nus to see. There's something wrong about lives, something inauthentic\nabout lives that are lived without facing the facts of our mortality\nand living accordingly, whatever the appropriate responses might be.\nHere are two stories not having to do with death per se that may help\nus get a feel for the oddity of trying to disregard these facts.\n\nSuppose that you're on a hot date, or about to go out on a hot date,\nwith Peggy Sue or, depending on your preferences, Billy Bob. And your\nroommate holds up an envelope and says, \"Written in this envelope are\ncertain facts about Peggy Sue or Billy Bob. I'm not going to tell you\nwhat these facts are yet. They're in the envelope. But I'll give you\nthe envelope and you can open it up and read them. But I do want to\ntell you this one thing. It is indeed the case that if you were to read\nthese facts, if you were to think about these facts, if you were to\nknow the things written down in the envelope, you would not want to go\nout with Peggy Sue.\"\n\nAnd you say to yourself, well, let's see. Right now I want to go out\nwith Peggy Sue, but if I knew these true--It's not that you think, oh\nyour roommate has made it up, that these are lies; these are slander.\nYou really believe, and it is in fact the case that the things written\ndown in the envelope are true. And so you know that if only you were to\nread these things in the envelope, you would change your mind and no\nlonger want to go out with her. And so what you say is, \"Don't show me\nthe envelope.\" That seems odd. It doesn't seem like it makes sense. If\nthere are things that would change your mind and you know that they\nwould change your mind about your behavior, how can it be rational to\ndisregard them?\n\nHere's another story. You're about to drink a milkshake, and your\nroommate comes rushing in and says, \"I've got the lab report. I had my\nsuspicions about the milkshake, and so I took a sample and I rushed it\ndown to the lab. I've got the lab report.\" You're about to drink it,\nright, because you're thirsty, it's a hot day, you love milkshakes. And\nyour roommate says, \"Inside the envelope are facts about this milkshake\nthat if--I promise you it is indeed the case--if you knew these facts,\nyou would not drink the milkshake anymore.\" And you say, \"Oh, thank\nGod. Don't open the envelope,\" and you drink the milkshake,\ndisregarding the facts.\n\nThat seems inappropriate. Well, if it really was true then that if\nonly we faced the facts about our mortality that we would live life\nrather differently, how could it be reasonable for us to disregard\nthose facts? Well, that's the puzzle. Or maybe we shouldn't call it a\npuzzle at all. Maybe the answer is, that just shows the disregard\noption is not really all that reputable. What we either have to do is\ndeny the claims I'm made about the nature of death, or else go on to\nask--supposing they are true--how should we live in light of them?\nMaybe the disregard option just is one that we can't actually take on\nas an intellectually acceptable alternative.\n\nBut I suspect that that's probably a little bit too quick, because\nreally there are two different ways in which facts could influence our\nbehavior. And if we're not careful we'll disregard this distinction,\neven though I think it's an important one. Here's the two ways. On the\none hand, it could be that certain facts, if you knew them, would\ncause you to behave differently without actually giving you any\nreason to behave differently. That's possibility number one.\nPossibility number two is the facts change your behavior by giving you\na reason to behave differently.\n\nLet me show you an example of the first possibility, because that's\nthe one I think we may be overlooking when we assume that disregarding\ncan't ever make any sense. So, there you are kissing, making out with\nPeggy Sue or Billy Bob--whoever it is--and your roommate bursts in and\nsays, \"I have in the envelope certain facts such that if you were to\nthink about them you would no longer want to kiss Peggy Sue, Billy\nBob.\" Let me just tell you what the facts in the envelope are. They're\ncertain facts about the nature of Peggy Sue's digestive system. Now,\nwell, you're making out after having had dinner, and while you're\nsitting there making out, food is making its way down Peggy Sue's\ndigestive tract, being turned into shit. And eventually it's going to\nbe excreted. And if you started picturing to yourself the feces inside\nPeggy Sue's digestive tract, and the fact that she's eventually going\nto be wiping the feces off of her behind, you might find it difficult\nto continue to engage in making out with Peggy Sue. It's not so--now\nthese are just facts, right? I didn't make any of these up, but there\nyou are, as I'm talking about them, you're just being grossed out as I\ndescribe them.\n\nNow, do any of these facts about the digestive system make it\ninappropriate to kiss another human being? Well, of course not. But for\nall that, thinking about those facts make it rather difficult, while\nyou're thinking about the facts, to continue enjoying kissing the\nperson. So there are certain facts about the digestive tract such that\nif you think about them you can't do something, kiss the person. But\nfor all that, it's not because you've got any good reason not to\nkiss the person. It's not that the facts about the human digestive\nprocess give you reason not to kiss her. They cause you to\nchange you behavior without giving you any reason to change your\nbehavior.\n\nSo, when the roommate comes running in, holding the envelope, and\nsays, \"I have in this envelope certain facts such that if you read\nthese facts, and thought about these facts, you would stop kissing this\nperson,\" the question you should put to your roommate is, \"Are these\nfacts that would merely cause me to change what I'm doing, or\nare these facts things that would give me some good reason to\nchange?\" If these are facts about how Peggy Sue likes to kiss and tell,\nor then goes around and talks about who's a good kisser and who's a bad\nkisser, maybe that gives you a reason to not continue what you're\ndoing. So the facts could be things that would give you reason\nto change your behavior. But the mere fact that they would\nchange your behavior doesn't yet tell you whether they're\nreason-generating facts. If they're mere causes and not reasons, then\nmaybe it's perfectly okay to disregard them. If your roommate comes in\nand starts trying to tell you facts about the human digestive system,\nyou say, \"Not now.\" Disregarding is sometimes the appropriate thing to\ndo.\n\nWell, what about the facts about death? Are the facts about death\nthings that it's appropriate to disregard? A bold claim would say,\n\"Yes.\" A bold claim would say, \"The facts about death, if I thought\nabout them, would change my behavior, but not because it would give me\na reason to change my behavior--simply because it would\ninfluence my behavior.\" And, given that, we might say, better to\nnot think about them. That would be the bold claim to make at this\npoint.\n\nSuppose, for example, that, the right way to live, in light of the\nfacts about death, is to live life to the fullest. But suppose if you\nthink about death you just get too depressed and you can't live life to\nthe fullest. It's not that the facts about death give you reason to\nstay in your room and sulk. It's just that the facts about death\ncause you to stay in your room and sulk. If that was the case,\nthen disregarding, always disregarding, the facts about death might\nwell be the appropriate response. Well, that would be a rather bold\nclaim. I'm not inclined to believe that the bold claim is right.\n\nShould we conclude therefore that, no, you should always be thinking\nabout the facts about death? No, I'm inclined to think that that other\nbold claim, on the other side, is probably mistaken as well. So there\nyou are, one more time, one last time, making out with Peggy Sue or\nBilly Bob and your roommate comes in and starts trying to tell you\nabout the fact that he's taken Shelly Kagan's class on death or he's\nbeen studying in some biology class, and he wants to tell you about how\nhuman bodies decay when they turn into corpses. As he begins to tell\nyou this story, you start picturing Peggy Sue as a rotting corpse.\nSuddenly, you don't really feel like kissing her anymore. It's sort of\nlike the digestive tract story. It's not that, as far as I can see, the\nfact that she's going to be a corpse gives you any reason not to\nkiss her. It's just that thinking about the fact that she's going to be\na corpse causes you to not want to kiss her, not be able to\nenjoy kissing her.\n\nSo, I'm inclined to think that the right position here is a kind of\nmoderate one, a modest one. There are times and places for thinking\nabout the facts of death. When you're kissing somebody--that is not the\ntime and that is not the place. The position that says, you should\nalways have the fact of your mortality forever before your mind's\neye--I think that's misguided. Similarly, though, anybody who says, you\nshould never think about the facts of mortality and the nature of\ndeath--I think that's misguided as well. There's a time and place. But\nthat still leaves us with the question. All right, so suppose this is\nthe time and place. If ever there was a time and place for thinking\nabout the facts of death and how it should influence our life, it's\nright now, in a class on death. So, we still have to face the question,\nhow should you live? What is the appropriate response to the\nfacts about life and death? That's the question we have to turn to next\ntime.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct22.html":{"url":"lct22.html","title":"Lecture 22","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 22 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nApril 12, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Last time, I distinguished between\ntwo ways in which thinking about the facts about the nature of death\ncould influence our behavior. On the one hand, it could give us reasons\nto behave or respond differently, and on the other hand it could merely\ncause us to behave differently. Insofar as it just happens to be some\nfact about human psychology that we behave this way or that way,\nperhaps the appropriate way to deal with the facts of death would be to\nsimply disregard them. I'm inclined to believe, however, that there are\nways in which thinking about the facts would not merely cause us to\nbehave one way rather than another but give us reason to behave\none way rather than another. And that's the question that I want to\nthen explore from here on out. In what circumstances, or in what ways,\nshould we behave one way rather than another?\n\nSo, I'm not merely going to draw on facts about how, as it happens,\nwe behave. It could be that if you dwelled upon the facts about death,\nyou would scream interminably until the moment you died--taking a tip\nfrom Tolstoy. But that doesn't itself show that that's an appropriate\nresponse; that might just be a mere causal fact about how we're built.\nThe question I want to ask is, how is it appropriate, in what ways is\nthere reason, to react one way rather than another?\n\nNow as I say, the thought seems very compelling for most of us that\nthere are ways in which it makes sense for the facts about death to\ninfluence how we live, what our attitudes are, what are emotions are.\nKafka, for example, said the meaning of life is the fact that it ends.\nNice little cryptic saying, as is typical of Kafka. But the suggestion,\nI suppose, is a fairly common one, that it's something deep about how\nwe should live, that we're going to die, that our life will come to an\nend. And the question we want to then explore is how should the fact,\nhow should recognizing the fact, that we're going to die, influence how\nwe live? How should we respond to that fact?\n\nNow actually, the very first kind of behavior, quote/unquote\nbehavior, that I want us to think about perhaps isn't strictly speaking\na form of behavior at all. I rather have in mind our emotional\nresponse, because indeed one of the most common reactions to death, I\nsuppose, is fear of death. Indeed, fear may in many cases be too\nweak a term--an extremely strong form of fear--terror of death is, I\nsuppose, a very common emotional response to death. And what I want to\ndo next is have us ask ourselves, well, is fear of death a\nrationally appropriate response?\n\nNow, the crucial word here is \"appropriate.\" I don't want to deny at\nall what I take to be the empirical fact that many people are afraid of\ndeath. How common a reaction that is, and how strong the fear is, I\nsuppose that would be something for psychologists or sociologists to\nstudy. And I'm not interested in that question. I take it that fear of\ndeath is very common. I want to know, is fear of death an appropriate,\na reasonable emotion?\n\nNow, in raising that question, I'm obviously presupposing the larger\nphilosophical thesis that it makes sense to talk about emotions as\nbeing appropriate or inappropriate. We can ask not only what emotions\ndoes somebody have, but we can also ask what emotions should\nthey have? Now, this point perhaps isn't an obvious one, so maybe it's\nworth dwelling on for a moment or two, before we turn to fear of death\nper se.\n\nWhat's another example of an emotion that's got some appropriateness\nconditions? So, in a moment I'll turn to asking, what are the\nconditions under which it's appropriate to be afraid of something?--but\nto make the more general point, look, take something like pride;\npride's an emotion. Under what conditions does it make sense to be\nproud of something? Well, I suppose at least two conditions jump out.\nFirst of all, the thing that you're proud of has to be some kind of\naccomplishment. If you were to say to me right now, \"I'm really proud\nof the fact that I'm breathing,\" I'd look at you in a noncomprehending\nfashion because it doesn't seem to me that breathing is difficult in\nany way, doesn't count as an accomplishment, and as such I can't\nunderstand how or why you would be proud of the fact that you're\nbreathing. Now, maybe if you suffered from asthma and you had to have\ngone through excruciating physical therapy in order to learn how to use\nyour lungs after some accident or something; maybe if we told a story\nlike that we could see how breathing naturally and normally would be an\naccomplishment, something to be proud of. But for all of us, I presume,\nit's not an accomplishment; hence it's not something that it's\nappropriate to be proud of.\n\nEven if we've got an accomplishment, that may not be enough. For\nsomething to be something that it makes sense for you to be proud of\nit, it's got to be in some way an accomplishment that reflects well on\nyou. Now, the most straightforward cases are cases where it's\nyour accomplishment, and the reason that pride makes sense is\nbecause you're the one who did this difficult thing. So, you got an A\non your philosophy paper and you tell me that you're proud and I\nunderstand that; getting an A on a philosophy paper is an\naccomplishment, and if you wrote the paper then I understand why you're\nproud. Of course, if what you did was go on the Internet and go to one\nof those sites where you pay money and somebody else writes an A paper\nfor you, well, I understand why maybe they should be proud that\nthey've written a great philosophy paper, but I don't see how this\nreflects especially positively upon you. So again, there's a kind of\nappropriateness condition for pride, where the object or the event or\nthe activity that you're proud of, or the feature, has to somehow\nreflect on you.\n\nNow, that's not to say that it's got to be your\naccomplishment, at least not in any straightforward, narrow sense. It\nmakes sense, for example, to be proud of your children's\naccomplishments because there's the right kind of connection between\nyou and your children. So, in some sense it's connected to you. And we\ncan have cases where we wonder about whether or not the connection is\ntight enough or what exactly the nature of the connection has to be.\nPerhaps as an American you took pride when the Americans win some event\nat the Olympics or the Tour de France or what have you, and you say to\nyourself, \"well look, I didn't ride the bicycle but for all that I'm an\nAmerican and an American won, I'm proud.\" And that makes sense; we can\nunderstand how you think the connection there is tight enough. On the\nother hand if you say, \"look, the Germans won the event in the Olympics\nand I'm really proud,\" and I ask, well, are you yourself German, do you\nhave German heritage, did you contribute to the German Olympics support\nteam? If none of that's true, then again the appropriateness condition\ndoesn't seem to be satisfied. It doesn't make sense to be\nproud.\n\nAll right, look, we could spend more time worrying about the\nconditions under which it makes sense to feel pride. But of course\nthat's not really my purpose here. My purpose of bringing that in was\njust to try to make good on the thought that emotions do have\nrequirements; not necessarily requirements for what you have to have in\nplace in order to feel the emotion. It's a harder question\nwhether all these things need to be in place in order to feel the\nemotion. But at least these things need to be in place in order for it\nto make sense for you to have the emotion, in order for it to be\nrational or reasonable to feel the emotion, in order for that emotional\nresponse to be an appropriate response to your circumstances or\nsituation.\n\nSo, let's ask ourselves, then, what are the appropriateness\nconditions for fear? Because armed with that set of conditions, we'll\nthen be able to go on and ask, is it appropriate to feel fear of death?\nNow, three conditions come to mind when I think about this question,\nwhen I've thought about this question over the years. The first is\nthis--and I suppose this first one's going to be fairly\nuncontroversial--in order to be afraid of something--even though I\nslipped in this, to talk about what you need to have in order to\nfeel fear, what I really mean is in order for it to make\nsense to feel fear--the thing that you're afraid of has to be\nbad.\n\nIf somebody were to say to me, \"I'm afraid that after class\nsomebody's going to give me an ice cream cone\", again I'd look at them\nin noncomprehension. I'd say, \"Why are you afraid of that? How could it\nmake any sense to be afraid?\" And again, it's not that somebody\ncouldn't give you an answer. They'd say, \"Oh I'm trying to lose weight\nbut I'm so weak and if they give me an ice cream cone then I'll just\neat it and that'll ruin my diet for the week,\" well, then I'd\nunderstand. From that point of view an ice cream cone is a bad thing\nand so that first condition on fear would be satisfied. But if you\ndon't have a story like that, if you're like most of us, most of the\ntime, and an ice cream cone's a pretty good thing, a source of some\npassing but at least genuine pleasure, then you say, \"How can you be\nafraid of having or getting or eating an ice cream cone?\" It doesn't\nmake sense.\n\nTo be afraid of something, it's got to be bad. It's one of the\nreasons why we sometimes look askance at people who have various kinds\nof phobias--fear of spiders or fear of dust or what have you, fear of\nbunnies--and you think, how does this make any sense? It's this cute\nlittle bunny; it's not dangerous. And maybe there are poisonous\nspiders, but most of the spiders we run across here in Connecticut are\nnot poisonous. Fear of spiders doesn't seem appropriate. It's not that\npeople can't have this kind of emotional reaction, it's that it\ndoesn't make sense. Maybe it's another matter if you live in\nAustralia, where there's poisonous snakes and spiders and other insects\neveryplace. All right.\n\nSo, condition number one: Fear requires something bad, as the object\nof your fear. I can fear getting a migraine, if I'm subject to\nmigraines. I can't fear the pleasure of looking at a beautiful sunset.\nThat's condition number one--bad object, something harmful. Condition\nnumber two is, there's got to be a nonnegligible chance of the bad\nstate of affairs happening, of the bad object coming to you. It's not\nenough that it's a logical possibility for fear to be a reasonable\nreaction. There's nothing logically inconsistent or logically\nincoherent about the possibility that I will face my death by being\nripped to pieces by Siberian tigers. It's not as though that's an\ninconsistent state of affairs. It's certainly logically possible, but\nit's so unlikely, it's so negligibly small a chance, that if anybody\nhere is afraid that they'll be ripped to pieces by tigers, then I can\nonly say the fear doesn't make any sense, it's not appropriate.\n\nAgain, we can tell special stories where that might be different.\nSuppose you tell me that, oh, when you're not a student, your work\nstudy program, what you do is, you work as an animal trainer, or you're\nplanning to work in the circus where you'll be training tigers, then\nI'll say, all right, now I suppose there's a nonnegligible chance\nyou'll be mauled and killed by tigers. I understand it. But for the\nrest of us, I suppose, the chance of being killed by tigers is, well,\nit's not literally zero, but it's close to zero, it's negligible. And\nso, fear of being eaten by tigers or mauled to death by tigers doesn't\nmake any sense.\n\nAnd once you get the point, of course, it would be easy to talk\nabout a variety of other things that the chances are so small--fear of\nbeing kidnapped by space creatures from Alpha Centauri, where I'll be\ntaken back to the lab and they'll prod me before they dissect me alive\nwithout anesthetic. Yes, I suppose there's some possibility of that.\nIt's not logically impossible. But again it's so vanishingly small a\nchance, and anybody who actually is afraid of that, the appropriate\nthing for us to say is that their fear is not appropriate. All right,\nso you need to have a chance of the bad thing, and it's got to be a\nlarge enough chance. And I suppose again there would be room for us to\nargue about how large a chance is large enough, but when you have\nvanishingly small chances then the fear doesn't make any sense. That's\ncondition number two.\n\nCondition number three, I think, is somewhat more controversial, but\nfor all that it still seems correct to me, and that's this. We need to\nhave a certain amount of uncertainty in order to have fear be\nappropriate. You need to have some--it's not clear how much--but at\nleast some significant amount of uncertainty about whether the bad\nthing will occur, and/or how bad the bad thing will be. To see the\npoint, to see the relevance of this third condition, imagine that a bad\nthing was going to happen to you with a nonnegligible chance. Indeed,\nfar from being so small that it's virtually not worth even considering,\nimagine that it's guaranteed that the bad thing is going to happen. So,\nthere's a bad thing that's going to happen, and you know precisely how\nbad it is. So you've got certainty with regard to the fact that the bad\nthing is going to happen, and certainly with regard to the size of the\nbad thing. I put it to you that in circumstances like that, fear is not\nan appropriate emotional response.\n\nSuppose that what happens is this. Every day you come to school, to\nthe office, whatever it is, and you bring a bagged lunch, and you put\nit in the office refrigerator. And you include, along with your lunch,\na dessert; let's say a cookie. And every day at one o'clock, when you\ngo to grab your lunch out of the refrigerator, you look inside and you\nsee somebody has stolen your cookie. Well, it's a bad thing; it's not\nthe worst thing in the world, but it's a bad thing to have somebody\nsteal your cookie. And furthermore, this is more than a negligible\nchance. So, we've got condition one, condition two in place--bad thing\nand a nonnegligible chance of it happening. In fact, not only is it not\na negligible chance that it's happening--guaranteed, it happens day\nafter day after day after day. Bad thing, guaranteed. And you know\nprecisely how bad it is. I put it to you, fear in that case doesn't\nmake any sense.\n\nMind you, there are other negative emotions that probably make\nsense, like anger and resentment. Who does this thief, whoever it is,\nthink that he or she is, to be stealing your cookie? They don't have\nthe right to do that! You can be angry, you can be resentful. You can\nbe sad that you don't have a dessert, day after day after day. But you\ncan't be afraid, because there's nothing here that it makes\nsense for you to be afraid of. Again, being a little sloppy, maybe you\nare afraid, but if so, fear doesn't make sense, when you know\nfor a certainty that the bad thing is coming and how bad it is.\n\nSuppose that the thief strikes at random, taking different people's\ndesserts from different bags at different times of the week, and you\nnever know who he or she is going to steal from. Then you might be\nafraid that you'll be the person whose cookie got stolen. Or if cookie\nseems to you too silly an example, imagine that what happens is\nsomebody breaks into dorm rooms. There's been a thief going around\nvarious dorms on campus and stealing the computer from the dorm room.\nWell there, fear makes sense; you're afraid that they'll steal your\ncomputer. Bad thing, nonnegligible chance, and lack of certainty.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose what happens is, this is one of those\nthieves like you always have in the movies, where he's such a master\nthief, or she's such a master thief, that they take pride in their\nwork, and so they announce it. They take out an ad in the Yale Daily\nNews and they say, \"On Wednesday, April 27th, I shall\nsteal the computer from so-and-so's room.\" And it doesn't matter what\nprecautions you take, something always happens, and that person's\ncomputer gets stolen. Well, again, you could be angry, you can be\npissed, you can be annoyed, you can feel stupid that you didn't take\nadequate precautions. But when the ad appears, with your name, and that\ndate, and all year the thief has always carried through on the\nannounced theft, I put it to you, fear doesn't make any sense, because\nif you know exactly what the size of the harm is going to be, and\nyou're guaranteed that the harm is coming, fear is no longer\nappropriate.\n\nSuppose that I have a little torture machine, a little pain\ngenerator, where I put your hand down and I hook it up to the\nelectrodes and I crank the dial and I pull the switch, and you feel an\nelectric shock. It makes sense to feel fear what the next shock is\ngoing to feel like, if the shocks vary in their intensity. But if the\nmachine's only got one setting, on and off, and all the shocks feel\nexactly the same, and I've done it for you, \"so look, okay, let me show\nyou what it feels like; it feels like that.\" Oh, not comfortable. Let\nme show you what it feels like, it feels like that; over and over, 5,\n6, 7, 8 times; we're doing some sort of weird psychology experiment\nhere. Well, you know exactly that it's coming, you know exactly what\nit's going to feel like. Fear, I put it to you, doesn't make any\nsense.\n\nSuppose the experiment's over now, and you think--you've gotten your\nten dollars and I refuse to let you go and I say, \"I'm going to do it\none more time, no worse than before.\" Well, you might not believe me\nand that might introduce the element of uncertainty and then perhaps\nfear would be appropriate. But if you believe me that one more pain\nexactly like the ones you felt before is coming, fear--anger makes\nsense, resentment makes sense, sadness that you're going to feel this\npain perhaps makes sense--but fear doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, three conditions. You need to have it's something bad. You need\nto have on the one hand nonnegligible chance that the bad thing's going\nto happen, and you have to have a lack of certainty. If you've got\ncertainty as to the nature of the bad and certainty that it's coming,\nthen fear doesn't make sense.\n\nOne of the points probably worth mentioning in passing--even when\nfear does make sense, there's a kind of proportionality condition that\nwe need to keep in mind as well. Even if there's a nonnegligible chance\nof the harm coming, and so fear is appropriate, it doesn't make fear\nappropriate if it's obsessive fear, horrendous fear, tremendous fear.\nMaybe some mild concern is all that's appropriate if the chances are\nsmall. Similarly, the amount of fear needs to be proportioned to the\nsize of the bad. That's perhaps why the cookie example, you\nmight think a lot of fear there's not appropriate because even if it\ncomes, how bad is it? Loss of a cookie. All right, so there are some\nconditions that need to be met before fear is appropriate at all, and\non the other hand even when fear is appropriate, it's still legitimate\nto ask, how much fear is appropriate?\n\nSo, armed with all of this, let's now turn to the question, is fear\nof death appropriate, and if so, how much? And immediately we see we\nneed to draw some distinctions. Well, what are we supposedly being\nafraid of when we are afraid of death? And two or perhaps three things\nneed to be distinguished. The first thing you might worry about is the\nprocess of dying. Some people find that the actual process at the end\nof their life is a painful and unpleasant one. Yes, I've given the\nexample of being mauled to death by tigers or eaten alive by tigers.\nWell, I imagine that would be a pretty unpleasant way to die. And so\ninsofar as there is some nonnegligible chance that you will die a\npainful death, then I suppose there's some room for some--an\nappropriate amount--of fear. Of course, we then have to ask, well, what\nis the chance that you'll die painfully? I've already indicated for\npeople in this room I rather imagine the chance of being mauled to\ndeath by tigers is vanishingly small. So, I think, no fear of that form\nof painful death is appropriate. And for that matter, I've got to\nsuggest that I suspect that fear of dying through a painful operation\nby the aliens from Alpha Centauri is not appropriate either.\n\nStill, the sad fact of the matter is that there are people in the\nworld who do suffer painful deaths, in particular, of course, because\nthe number of diseases that might kill us off in their final stages are\nsometimes painful. Now, one of the interesting facts is that we could\nof course minimize or eliminate the pain by giving people adequate pain\nmedication. And so, it comes as a rather unpleasant bit of news that\nmost hospitals do not provide adequate pain medication, in many, many\ninstances, at the end of life. Why? That's a whole other complicated\nquestion. But I suppose if somebody were to say to me that--look, I\nread the newspaper, there are studies done periodically about whether\nor not there's adequate pain medication at the end of life and the\nstudies suggest, year after year, that no, we still don't in general\nprovide adequate pain medication. If you were to say to me, \"In light\nof that I've got some fear that this may happen to me,\" well, I'd\nunderstand that. Again, if you said to me, \"I can't sleep for fear that\nthis is going to happen to me,\" I'd want to say, well, that sort of\nfear strikes me as disproportionate.\n\nBut at any rate, I suppose that when people say that they're afraid\nof death, although some of them, in some moments, might have in mind,\nwhat they mean is that they're afraid of the process of dying, I take\nit that that's not actually the central fear that people mean to be\nexpressing. People mean to suggest that they're afraid of death itself,\nthey're afraid of being dead. And with regard to that, I want to\nsuggest, I don't actually think the relevant conditions are\nsatisfied.\n\nLook, let's think about what they were again. There was a certain\namount of uncertainty. Well, of course, with regard to being dead\nthere's no uncertainty at all. You're guaranteed that you're going to\ndie. And indeed, condition number one, that the bad thing--for fear to\nmake sense the object of my fear has to be a bad thing. Well, let's ask\nourselves, is being dead intrinsically a bad thing? It doesn't seem to\nme that it is.\n\nOf course, this all presupposes the positions about the nature of\ndeath that I argued for in the first half of this semester. There's\nnothing mysterious or unknown about death. Look, suppose you thought\nthere was. Suppose you believe in the afterlife, or at least the\npossibility of an afterlife, and you're worried that you might go to\nhell. Well, then fear makes some sense. If there's a possibility,\nnonnegligible in your mind, that there'll be a painful experience after\nyou die--not guaranteed--if you're a bad enough sinner so that you're\ncertain you're going to hell, then again I think condition number three\nisn't satisfied. But if like most of us you wouldn't know if you were a\nbad enough sinner or not, and so there's some nonnegligible chance of\nthis bad thing, without certainly, well, somebody like that who says\nthey're afraid of being dead, for fear that they might find themselves\nin hell, at least I understand that.\n\nBut on the physicalist picture where death is the end, where when\nyour body decays there's no experience at all, then it seems to me that\nthe first condition on fear isn't satisfied. The badness of death after\nall, according to the deprivation account, is the mere absence of a\ngood. And it seems to me the mere absence of a good is not the right\nkind of thing to be afraid of. Suppose I give you an ice cream cone,\nand you like it. You wish you could have a second ice cream cone. But I\ndon't have a second ice cream cone to share with you. So you know that\nafter the first ice cream cone is over, you won't have a second ice\ncream cone. That's a pity, that's a lack of something good. And now\nyou're telling me, \"I'm afraid; I'm afraid of the fact that there will\nbe this period after the first ice cream cone is done in which I'm not\ngetting a second ice cream cone. I'm afraid because of the badness of\ndeprivation of ice cream.\" I say to you, deprivations per se are not\nthe kind of thing to be afraid of; they're not bad in the right kind of\nway.\n\nSo, if death is bad only or most centrally insofar as it's a\ndeprivation of the good things in life, there's nothing bad there to be\nafraid of. Well, that doesn't mean there isn't anything here in the\nneighborhood. After all, we have to worry not just about the fact that\nwe're going to die, we have to worry about when we're going to die. We\nmight be certain that death is going to come, but we're not certain\nthat death is going to come a long time from now, as opposed to soon.\nSo, perhaps the relevant thing to be afraid of is the possibility that\nyou'll die soon.\n\nConsider an analogy. Suppose that you're at a party, it's a great\nparty, you wish you could stay and stay and stay, but this is taking\nplace back in high school, and what's going to happen is your mother is\ngoing to call at a certain point and tell you it's time to go home.\nNow, let's just imagine there's nothing bad about being at home; it's\nneutral. You just wish you could stay but you know you can't. If you\nknow the call is going to come at midnight, guaranteed, then there's\nnothing to be afraid of. You might resent the fact that your mother is\ngoing to call you at midnight, be annoyed at the fact that she won't\nlet you stay out till one o'clock like your other friends, but there's\nnothing to be afraid of. There, it's 11 o'clock and you're saying, \"I'm\nterrified of the fact that the call's going to come at midnight; I know\nit's going to come.\" See, fear there doesn't make sense, because it\ndoesn't have the relevant degree of uncertainty. You know exactly\nwhat's coming and you know for a certainty that it's coming; fear isn't\nappropriate.\n\nWell, suppose instead of what happens is a guarantee that your\nmother's going to call at midnight, what we've got is your mother's\ngoing to call sometime between 11 and 1. Now, some fear makes sense.\nMost of the time she calls around 12, 12:30; sometimes she calls at 1\nfor parties; occasionally she calls at 11. You're worried now, there's\na nonnegligible chance she'll call at 11 rather than sometime later, 12\nor 1 o'clock. There's a bad thing, some nonnegligible chance, and the\nabsence of certainty. Now some degree of fear makes sense. And perhaps\nthat's what we've got with regard to death. If so, we might say the\ncrucial ingredient here, by virtue of which death is something that\nit's appropriate for us to be afraid of is because of the\nunpredictability.\n\nEven if we had variability we might not have unpredictability.\nThat's a point that we touched upon previously. It's the\nunpredictability that leaves you in a position of not knowing whether\ndeath will come soon, or death will come late. Will you die at 20, will\nyou die at 50, will you die at 80, or will you die at 100? It seems to\nme that if it weren't for the unpredictability, fear of death wouldn't\nmake any sense at all. Given that we do have unpredictability, some\nfear of death might make sense; although again it's important to be\nclear about what it is that it makes sense to be afraid of. It's not\nbeing dead per se. I remain of the opinion that being dead per se is\nnot the sort of thing it makes sense to be afraid of, once you've\nconcluded that death is the end. The only thing that it might make some\nsense to be afraid of is that you might die too soon--earlier rather\nthan later.\n\nOf course, having noted that point, we then have to ask, well how\nmuch fear is appropriate? How great is the chance that you'll die too\nsoon? Your fear needs to be proportioned to the likelihood. How likely\nis it that you will die in the next year, or five years, or for that\nmatter 10 or 20 years? The fact of the matter is for most of you,\nalmost all of you, the chances are very unlikely indeed; not quite\nnegligible, but rather small. For a healthy 20-year-old, for example,\nthe chances of dying in the next five or ten years are extremely small,\nin which case even if some slight fear might be called for, no\nsignificant amount of fear seems called for. So, if somebody were to\nsay to me, \"look, the facts about death are so overwhelming that I'm\nterrified of death,\" all I can say in response is not, that I don't\nbelieve you, but for all that it seems to me terror of death is not an\nappropriate response. It doesn't make sense given the facts.\n\nNow, having said that, that doesn't mean that there may not be some\nother emotion, some other negative emotion that is appropriate. Fear of\ndeath strikes me as, for the most part, overblown; it's widespread, I\nsuppose, but for the most part inappropriate. But that doesn't mean\nthat--As I suggested before in working through some of these examples,\nsometimes anger makes sense; sometimes resentment makes sense; sorrow,\nregret, sadness, that may make sense. So, in having argued that for the\nmost part fear of death does not make sense, I haven't yet given us any\nreason to think that there might not be other emotions, negative\nemotions, that do make sense. So let's ask. What about some of those\nother possible emotions?\n\nWhat negative emotion, if any, does it make sense to feel about\ndeath itself, the fact that you're going to die? Well, of course, look,\nit's also worth bearing in mind, since I've argued that immortality\nwould be bad, the fact that you will die is not actually bad. It's good\nbecause it saves you from the unpleasant aspect of an eternal, dreary,\ndreadful immortal existence. Still, we might say, most of us, almost\nall of us, die too soon. So, what about that? We die before life has\nyielded up all the goods that it could have given us. So what is the\nappropriate negative emotional response here? Or is there one?\n\nI suppose the natural second suggestion is anger. You might say,\nlook, maybe fear isn't right, isn't appropriate, but anger. I'm angry.\nI want to shake my fist at the universe and curse the universe for\ngiving me only 50 years or 70 years or 80 years even 100 years, when\nthe world is such a rich, incredibly fantastic place that it would take\nthousands of years or longer to exhaust what it has to offer. So, isn't\nanger an appropriate response?\n\nAnd again, I think the answer is not so clear that it is, because,\nlike all the other emotions, anger itself has appropriateness\nconditions. In order for anger to make sense, well, here's condition\nnumber one. It seems to me it's got to be directed at a person, it's\ngot to be directed at an agent, it's got to be directed at some thing\nthat had some choice over what it was doing to you. So, when your\nroommate, whatever it is, spills coffee on your computer, destroying\nthe hard drive or whatever it is, because they were careless, even\nthough you told them previously to be more careful, anger makes sense.\nIt's directed at your roommate, who's a person, who had some control\nover what they were doing. Your roommate's an agent. If you want to get\nangry at me for the grades that you receive in this class, well,\nat least condition number one makes sense; you're directing your anger\nat an agent, at an individual person who has some control over how I\nbehave, how they behave.\n\nCondition number two, I suppose--this may not be all the conditions,\nbut at least a second one is--anger makes sense when, and only when,\nthe agent has wronged you, has treated you in a way that it was morally\ninappropriate for them to teat you. If your roommate has been doing\nthings that you don't like, but they haven't done anything wrong, anger\ndoesn't make sense. When you are angry at them, you are revealing the\nfact that you think they've mistreated you. Mistreatment requires the\nnotion of they've behaved toward you in a way that morally they\nshouldn't. All right, these strike me as two conditions that need to be\nin place in order for anger to be an appropriate emotional\nresponse.\n\nOf course, again, we no doubt feel anger in other cases, although\ntypically when we're angry at inanimate objects it's because we've\npersonified them. Your paper is due, you're rushing off to class,\nyou're about to print it out, and your computer crashes, and you get\nangry at the computer. Well, what's going on there, I suppose, is\nyou've personified the computer. You have fallen into the trap,\nunderstandable, natural, of viewing the computer as though it was a\nperson who had deliberately chosen to fail right now, letting you down\nyet again. And I understand this sort of behavior; I do this sort of\nthing as well. But of course you can step back. At least, once your\nanger has subsided, you can step back and say, look, getting angry at\nyour computer doesn't really make sense, because your computer is not a\nperson; your computer is not an agent; your computer didn't have any\nchoice or control.\n\nSuppose that--take those two conditions and now ask ourselves, does\nit make sense then to be angry at the fact that we're going to die? And\nI suppose the answer is going to be, well, look, who is it, or what is\nit that you think is the cause of our mortality, or the fact that we\nonly get our 50 or 80 years? Here's two crude, basic alternatives. You\nmight believe in God, a kind of classic, theistic, conception of God,\naccording to which God is a person who makes decisions about what to\ndo. And God has condemned us to death. That's what happens in Genesis,\nGod punishes Adam and Eve by making them die. All right, that's picture\nnumber one. Picture number two is you just think there's this\nimpersonal universe, atoms swirling in the void, coming together in\nvarious combinations, but there's no person behind the scene\ncontrolling all of it.\n\nLet's consider the two possibilities. Possibility number one, God.\nWell, look, if you've got the God view, at least we satisfy the first\nof our appropriateness conditions. We can say, look; we can say, I'm\nangry at God for condemning us to a life that's short, that's so\ninadequate, relative to the riches that the world offers us. That's\ncondition number one. But what about condition number two? Condition\nnumber two, after all, requires that God has mistreated us in giving us\nour 50 or 80 or 100 years. And is that the case? Has God wronged us?\nHas God treated us in some way that isn't morally justified? If not,\nanger at God, resentment of God, wouldn't make sense.\n\nSuppose your roommate comes into the suite and has a box of candy,\nand he gives you a piece of candy, and you enjoy it. And he gives you a\nsecond piece of candy and you enjoy it. And he gives you a third piece\nof candy and you enjoy it. And you ask for a fourth piece of candy, and\nhe won't give it you. Has he wronged you? Has he treated you\nimmorally? Does he owe you more candy? It's not clear that he or\nshe does. But if not, then being angry--again, I would certainly\nunderstand it if you got angry, in the sense that it's a perfectly\ncommon enough response. But is anger an appropriate response to\nyour roommate for giving you something, and then not giving you more?\nIt's not clear that it is an appropriate response. The\nappropriate response actually seems to me to be, not one of anger, but\ngratitude. Your roommate didn't owe you any candy at all, and they gave\nyou four pieces, or whatever it was, the number just was. You might\nwish you could have more, you might be sad that you can't have more,\nbut anger doesn't seem appropriate. God doesn't, as far as I can see,\nowe it to us to give us more life than what we get.\n\nWell, suppose we don't believe in the God theory but the universe\ntheory. Well then, of course ,even condition number one isn't\nsatisfied. The universe is not a person, is not an agent, has no choice\nand control. And as such, again, it just seems to me that anger then--I\ncan lift my fist and curse the universe; of course, what I'm doing then\nis, I'm personifying the universe, treating the universe as though it\nwas a person that deliberately decided to make us die too soon. But\nhowever common that response might be, it makes no sense rationally if\nthe universe is not a person. It's just atoms swirling, forming various\nkinds of combinations. Anger at the fact that I'm going to die, or die\ntoo soon, doesn't make sense either.\n\nWell, what about sorrow? Maybe I should just be sad at the fact that\nI'm going to die too soon. And I think some emotion along that line\ndoes make sense. The world's a wonderful place. It would be better to\nhave more of it. I'm sad that I don't get more, that I'm not going to\nget more.\n\nBut having had that thought, I immediately find myself with another\nthought. Although it's a pity I don't get more, I'm extremely lucky to\nhave gotten as much as I get. The universe is just this swirling mass\nof atoms, forming clumps of various kinds of things, and dissolving.\nMost of those atoms don't get to be alive at all. Most of those atoms\ndon't get to be a person, falling in love, seeing sunsets, eating ice\ncream. It's extraordinarily lucky of us to be in this select, fortunate\nfew.\n\nLet me close then with an expression of this thought. This is from\nKurt Vonnegut's book, Cat's Cradle. This is a kind of prayer\nthat one of the characters in the novel says--is supposed to say--at\nthe deathbed.\n\nGod made mud.\n God got lonesome.\n So God said to some of the mud, \"Sit up.\"\n\"See all I've made,\" said God. \"The hills, the sea, the sky, the\nstars.\"\n And I, with some of the mud, had got to sit up and look around.\n Lucky me, lucky mud.\n I, mud, sat up and saw what a nice job God had done.\n Nice going God!\n Nobody but you could have done it God! I certainly couldn't\nhave.\n I feel very unimportant compared to You.\n The only way I can feel the least bit important is to think of all the\nmud that didn't even get to sit up and look around.\n I got so much, and most mud got so little.\n Thank you for the honor!\n Now mud lies down again and goes to sleep.\n What memories for mud to have!\n What interesting other kinds of sitting-up mud I met!\n I loved everything I saw [Vonnegut 1963].\n\n\n\nIt seems to me that the right emotional response isn't fear, it\nisn't anger, it's gratitude that we're able to be alive at\nall.\n\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n---\n\nReferences\n\nVonnegut, Kurt. 1963.

Whatever the content of your life, the\nfact that at least you've been able to live at all--As he put it, most\nmud isn't lucky enough to sit up. He feels lucky to have been some of\nthe sitting-up mud. He loved everything he saw. When I read that quote,\nI did not know that Kurt Vonnegut had died the night before.\nImmediately after the class ended, a visitor to the class brought this\nfact to my attention. So, I can't pass without commenting on that\ndeath, and just remark that I hope that to the very end, Kurt Vonnegut,\nwho lived until he was 84, realized how lucky he was to be some of the\nsitting-up mud.\n\nThe question I want to turn to now is this. So, we've been going\nover the various facts about the nature of life and death. And the\nquestion then is, how should we live, in light of the fact that we're\ngoing to die? Previously, we've talked about what emotional response we\nshould have to that. And I've argued, as I just reminded us, that\nalthough perhaps the most common reaction is one of fear or terror at\ndeath, it may in fact be that we should be grateful and consider\nourselves lucky that we were able to have had life as well--life at\nall.\n\nBut how, then, should we live in light of the fact that we're going\nto die? And the immediate answer that comes to mind seems almost like a\njoke. I want to say, well, we should be careful, given that we\ncan die, that we will die.\n\nThere used to be a TV show, a cop show called Hill Street\nBlues. The show began every day with the sergeant going over the\nvarious crimes and investigations that were going to fill up the day's\nepisode. And he'd always end, as he sent off his police, the cops. He'd\nend by saying, \"Be careful\" or \"Be careful out there.\"\n\nBut the particular kind of care that I have in mind isn't just this\npure fact, that if you're not careful, you won't notice that the car's\ncoming down the street and you'll hit by the car and that'll be the\nend. The fact that we're going to die intuitively seems to require a\nparticular kind of care, because, as we might put it, you only\ngo around once, right? You don't get to do it again. And so, it seems\nas though the fact that we're mortal, the fact that we've got a finite\nlifespan, requires us to face the fact that intuitively we can blow it.\nWe could do it wrong.\n\nNow, the nitpicky part of me wants to point out that it can't be\nmortality, per se, that has this implication. Even if we lived forever,\nwe could still do it wrong. After all, whatever it is you've filled\nyour life with, with an immortal infinite life, there's still going to\nbe the particular pattern of actions and activities that you engage in.\nAnd that particular pattern could still be one that wasn't the best\npattern that was available to you. So, the possibility of having blown\nit, of having lived the wrong kind of life, is a possibility that's\ngoing to be true of us, whether or not we're mortal.\n\nAnd yet, for all that, it seems as though mortality adds an extra\nrisk, an extra danger of blowing it. Look, suppose we lived forever and\njust have a kind of simplistic example. You might say, imagine somebody\nwho spends his eternity counting the integers--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Well,\nthat might not be as valuable as an eternity spent doing something\nelse, let's say, doing more complicated math. But still, if you've\nspent a million years or a billion years counting the integers and then\nrealized that was sort of pointless, you could always start over by\ndoing more interesting, more deep, more worthwhile math.\n\nThe immortality gives you a chance of starting over. It gives you\nthe possibility of do-overs. We might then worry that what's especially\nbad about death, the fact that we're mortal, is that it robs us of the\nchance of do-overs. But of course, that's not quite right either. Even\nif you don't live forever, you live 80 years or 100 years, you have the\nchance to reappraise your life at the age of 20 or 30 or 50 and decide\nyou need to change course. So, it's not exactly as though the\npossibility of do-overs disappears by death itself, via death itself.\nStill, the thought that death comes when it does seems to push us in\nthe direction of thinking we've still got to be very careful because,\nof course, given that we're mortal, we have only a limited period of\ntime in which to do the do-overs.\n\nThere are two kinds of mistakes, really, that we might catch\nourselves in. We might discover, on the one hand, that we made some bad\nchoices in terms of what we were aiming for. And on the other hand, we\nmight find even if we made the right choices in terms of our goals, we\nflubbed it in terms of actually accomplishing what we were trying to\naccomplish. And so we literally have to start over again, and try\nagain. So, there's two kinds of care that we have to take. We have to\nbe careful in our aims and we have to be careful in our execution of\nour aims, because we have, as it were, a rather limited amount of time\nto do it over.\n\nNow, again, the nitpicky part of me wants to say strictly speaking,\nit's not the fact that we are mortal, per se, that all by itself means\nwe have to be especially careful. After all, suppose there just weren't\nall that many things worth doing. And suppose they weren't all that\ncomplicated, all that difficult to do well. Suppose there were only\nfive things worth doing. And even if you couldn't necessarily do\nevery single one of them right the first time out, at most it would\ntake two or three tries. And by a try I mean maybe an hour or two.\nWell, that would be a pretty impoverished world that could only offer\nus that much. But after all, if that was the way the world worked and\nwe had a hundred years, we wouldn't really have to worry all that much\nabout being careful. We'd have plenty of time to aim for each of the\nfive things worth having and plenty of time to get each one of the five\nthings right. A hundred years of life would be more than enough. We\nwouldn't have to be careful.\n\nSo, it's not just the fact that we're mortal that requires us to be\ncareful. It's the fact that we have a relatively short span of life\nrelative to how much there is worth aiming for, and how complicated and\ndifficult it can be to get those things and get them right. It's\nbecause of the fact that there's so much to do and doing it properly\nthat we have to be careful. We just don't have enough time to flail\naround, try a little of this, try a little of that. Somebody who lives\nlike that may well find that the things they aimed for weren't really\nthe best choices. You don't have to decide that these things weren't\nworth having at all, given the relatively short period of time we've\ngot. We've got the extra burden of deciding what are the things\nmost worth going after. And we have to face the prospect, the\nchance, that we'll look back and discover that we didn't make the best\nchoices there. We aimed for the wrong things, not necessarily things\nthat weren't worth having, but given the limited number of things we\nwere going to be able to fill our lives with, in that sense, the wrong\nchoices. And we may discover as well that we were not sufficiently\ncareful, attentive in how we tried to achieve these things. Because\nit's not as though--although given the way life is, you've got the\nchance for do-overs, you don't have time for a whole lot of do-overs.\nAnd so what death forces us to do is, to be careful.\n\nAn analogy that comes to mind here is an artist who goes--a musician\nwho goes into a recording studio. And look, he can start trying to\nrecord his songs to cut an album. And he may only have a certain number\nof songs in his repertoire. And so if he's got a long enough period of\ntime, a month in the recording studio, he's got plenty of time, or\nshe's got plenty of time, to sing a couple of songs. Maybe these\nwouldn't be the best things to record. Let's give it a try and we'll\nsee. Didn't get it right the first take. Let's record it again. Let's\ntry it a third time. Let's try it a fourth time. If you've got enough\ntime, it's less pressing to get clear before you start, or as you're\ngoing along, what are the songs I should try to record, and can I get\nit on one take, or at most two?\n\nBut if instead of having a month in the recording studio, you've got\nonly a week in the studio, or a day in the studio, suddenly\neverything's much more pressing. Time is much more precious. You've got\nto decide early on just which are the songs that it makes sense to\nrecord? And yeah, there are some other songs, but these seem to be the\nbetter choices. And when you record them, you can't be as careless and\ninattentive as you try to get them down. You've got to try to get it\nright the first time, or at worst, the second time.\n\nThat's, it seems to me, the situation we find ourselves in, not just\ngiven the fact that we die, but, we might say, given how incredibly\nrich the world is, how many things it offers us, how many choices we\nhave in terms of what's worth going after. But for many of these\nthings, given how difficult they are to accomplish, although we've got\nthe chance for do-overs, both in terms of changing our mind about what\nwe should be aiming at, and trying again, for the things we have\naimed at, we've got to be careful. The fact about our death requires\npaying attention. It requires care.\n\nWell, having said that, of course, the immediate question then, is\nall right, so I'm paying attention. I'm trying to be careful. What\nshould I do with my life? How shall I--What should I fill it\nwith? We've, previously in the class, talked about the possibility that\nbeing alive, per se, may have some value. But above and beyond whatever\nstand we take on that, it's certainly also the case that part of what\nadds to the value of our lives are the contents of our lives.\nAnd so we need to ask, well, what kinds of contents should we try to\nfill our lives with? Now, I won't try to answer that. To ask the\nquestion, what are the things really worth going after in life? is to\ncome up to the edge of asking, well, just what is the meaning of life?\nWhat's really worth going after? And although that is indeed an\nimportant, perhaps the important question, it's the question, I\nthink, for a different class. And so having come close to the edge of\nthat question, I'm going to now back away from it.\n\nBut still, it seems we might say, in broad strokes, there are two\ndifferent strategies that we could adopt. And it's worth at least\npausing to think about these two strategies. Strategy number one says\ngiven that you've only got a finite amount of time--Actually, the basic\nunderlying thought behind both strategies is just this. We haven't got\nmuch time. Pack as much as you can into life. Pack as much as you can\nin. But there are two basic strategies about how do you put that idea\ninto practice. And strategy number one says given the dangers of\nfailure if you aim too ambitiously, you should settle for the kinds of\ngoals that you're virtually guaranteed that you'll accomplish. The\npleasures of food, company, sex, ice cream. One of the paper topics\nasks you to reflect on the philosophy, \"Eat, drink, and be merry, for\ntomorrow you die.\" Well, that's one of the strategies. We're going to\nbe dead tomorrow. And so while we're here, let's try to pack in as much\nas we can, by going for the things that we've got a very high chance of\nactually accomplishing.\n\nStrategy number two says that's all well and good. You've got a\npretty high chance of succeeding at that. The trouble with strategy\nnumber one is the goods that you can achieve, the sort of sure thing\ngoods are small. They're rather small potatoes, as things go. Some of\nthe most valuable goods in life are things that don't come so readily,\ndon't come with guarantees of achieving them. You might want to write a\nnovel, compose a symphony, or for that matter raise--marry and raise a\nfamily. Some of these things, strat--fans of strategy number two argue,\nthese things are the most valuable things that life can offer us. So\nthat a life filled with these larger goods is a more valuable life than\na life filled with the small potatoes goods. I suppose fans of the\n\"Eat, drink, and be merry\" strategy don't like to call those \"small\npotatoes goods,\" but that's the kind of language that might be offered\nby fans of strategy number two.\n\nAnd it seems to me that as a claim about which life, if only you had\nit, if you had a guarantee--If God were going to say, \"Look, which life\ndo you want? I promise you'll get it. The life filled with food and\ndrink or the life filled with accomplishment?\"--perhaps most of us\nwould say well, it's the life filled with accomplishment that's the\nmore valuable life. The trouble, of course, is, the life with the\ngreater accomplishments, the life aiming for greater accomplishments,\nis also a life with a greater chance of failure. You aim for writing\nthe great American novel and ten years later, you still haven't\nfinished it. Twenty years later, you decide you don't have it in you to\nwrite the great American novel. You try to produce a business and it\ngoes under.\n\nSo, what's the right strategy to take? I suppose many of us would be\ninclined to say, well, the third strategy. There's a third strategy\nthat's the obviously right thing to do, which is, get the right\nmixture. Aim for a certain number of--what should we call them? Large\npotatoes. Aim for a certain number of the large accomplishments,\nbecause if you do manage to get them, your life will have more value.\nBut also throw in a certain sprinkling of the smaller things, where\nyou're at least assured of having gotten something out of life. Well,\nthat's all well and good as well, but it just now brings us to the next\nquestion. What is the right mixture, after all? Well, I'm not going to\ntry to answer that one either. But again, those of you who choose the\ntopic, the \"Eat, drink, and be merry\" question, basically I'm inviting\nyou, in that topic, to reflect on that question.\n\nHere's a different thought. The entire, as I said, the underlying\nthought behind the go-for-the-big-things, go-for-the-small-things, was\npack it all in. The underlying thoughts seem to be, look, as long as\nyou've got a life that's got valuable contents, the more, the better.\nYou might say here's common ground between the two strategies--the\nmore, the better.\n\nNow previously, we've--I've argued that immortality would not\nactually be a good thing. Eventually rich and incredible as the world\nis, eventually, the goods of life would run out and immortality would\nbe dreadful. But having said that, that's not to suggest that we--most\nof us--come remotely close to that condition. For most of us, it's\ncertainly true that dying at 30 deprives you of goods that would have\ncome to you, if only you'd lived to 40. And dying at 40 deprives you of\ngoods that would have come to you if only you'd lived to 50 or 60 or\n80. So, one thing that we're inclined to agree is, other things being\nequal, the longer your life, the better. So here's a life, 50 years\nlong. And suppose you live it with a certain amount of value in your\nlife, 100 value points, whatever that is, whatever the--however our\nunits of measuring just how good a life is. We'd say, look, better to\nhave a life at that value, instead of going through 50 years, went for\n100 years. Fair enough. We might say, we all agree, don't we, that\nquantity of life's a good thing. And that does seem plausible. [See\nFigure 23.1]\n\nBut at the same time we'll want to immediately say quantity of life\nmay matter, but it's not the only thing that matters. Quality of life\nmatters as well. And again, that point's fairly uncontroversial. If you\nhad to choose between your life of 50 years at 100 value points or 50\nyears at whatever that is, 130 value points, you'd rather have the\nsecond life. The length of life isn't the only thing we care about. The\noverall quality of your life is something we care about as well. And\nthis, of course, is another topic that we've talked about previously.\nJust what is it that goes into making a life better than another? So,\nwe now see, summing it up, yeah, got to pay attention to quality, got\nto pay attention to quantity or duration. [See Figure 23.2]\n\nOf course, the reason I just corrected myself is because you might\nsay, if you want to think about it mathematically, it all is just a\nmatter of quantity. As long as when we measure quantity, we bear in\nmind we need to measure not just the length of the life, but the height\nof the box. So, the area of the box here is 50 x 100 units, so whatever\nthat is, that's 5,000. I'm going to get another giggle here, right.\nImagine our little units. It's a quality, one unit of quantity--one\nunit of quality for a year. So, it's a quality year unit, whatever it\nis, 5,000 units. Here 6,500. You might say, look, we can capture the\nthought that the duration of your life matters, the quality of your\nlife matters, by multiplying the two together. And without getting hung\nup on the numbers, as though there was any kind of precision here, the\nunderlying thought's fairly clear. The area of the box represents the\noverall quality--the overall quantity that you managed to cram into\nyour life in your 50 years.\n\nAnd we could start measuring different kinds of lives. We might\nstart worrying about well, look, suppose I could live 50 years at 130\nor I could live, whatever it is, 100 years at some other number that's\na little bit less. We might say, oh, less quality, but longer quantity,\nlonger duration, more valuable life filled in that last box. We see how\nit goes. But the question we need to ask is--so, if we've got this more\nrich sense of quantity, where we multiply the duration of the life\ntimes the how good a life you're having while you've got it, does that\ngive adequate place to what we think is valuable? Does that give\nadequate place to quality in life?\n\nLet me draw some different boxes, some different possible lives to\nchoose between. Suppose you had a nice long life, 150 years. Again,\njust for the sake of concreteness, we assign 50 quality points. So, the\narea is 7,500. Let's suppose, so you can get a feel for this, let's\nsuppose that the best life lived on earth so far was worth a 10. So\nthis is an incredible life, to be a 50. And you get it for 150 years. A\nvery nice life. Now, compare it with this life. Suppose that this life\nisn't really all that good in terms of how well off you are at any\ngiven time. It's plus one. Zero would be a life not worth having,\nthough no worse than nonexistence. Negative numbers would be lives\npresumably that would be you're better off dead. This life is just\nbarely worth having. It's plus one. But it's a very, very, very long\nlife, so long that I couldn't draw it to scale. That's why we've got\nthe \"...\" in the middle. Suppose it goes on for 30,000 years. Well, the\nmath here is pretty easy. 30,000 times one is 30,000 in terms of the\narea. Okay. [See Figure 23.4]\n\nSo, trying to choose between these two lives. Life A or Life B? In\nterms of quantity, our enriched notion of quantity, where you measure\nthe length of the life times the height of the box, Life B's got more\nquantity of what matters--30,000 versus 7,500. And yet, most of us,\nwhen we think about this choice, do not find B to be a preferable life,\neven though the quantity of value--Just suppose we could measure\nquantity of whatever the goods are that we've got crammed into our\nlife. Well, this has very, very, very small amounts stretched over a\nvery long time. The quantity's larger, but Life A seems preferable.\nNow, for any--at least, this may not be true for everybody, but for\nthose of us who share that thought, you might say quantity isn't all\nit's about. Or when we try to take quality into account, it wasn't so\nmuch that we couldn't measure it, it's that if you reduce the\nimportance of quality into, fold it into quantity, so that what it's\nall about is the total amount that you're getting, well the total\namount's bigger in B than A. If you don't think B's a better life, that\nsuggests that totals aren't what it's all about.\n\nWell, what else might we then choose between with regard to A and B?\nWell, the natural response is to say, even though Life A is shorter, it\nattains a kind of peak, a kind of height that isn't approached anyplace\nin Life B. And perhaps, then, in evaluating lives and choosing between\nrival lives, we can't just look for the quantity of good, we have to\nlook at the peaks. We have to look at the heights. In choosing between\nlives, it's important to think not just about how much did you pack in,\ntotal, but what were the greatest goods that you had or accomplished in\nyour life? And perhaps, then, we should conclude, quality can trump\nquantity. Perhaps with the right quality in place, quantity becomes of\nsecondary importance. Yeah, it might be that if we could have a longer\nlife where we achieved great things, rather than a shorter life where\nwe achieved great things, better to have the longer life. Quantity\nmight matter, too, as long as we think the quality's what matters the\nmost.\n\nBut a more radical version of the theory would say, actually,\nquality's all that matters. The peaks are all that matter. That,\nat any rate, is the position that gets expressed by H√∂lderlin in the\npoem \"To the Parcae,\" to the fates. That was in one of the essays that\nI had you read. But let me read that now. \"To the Parcae.\"\n\nA single summer grant me, great powers, and\n a single autumn for fully ripened song\n that, sated with the sweetness of my\n playing, my heart may more willingly die.\n The soul that, living, did not attain its divine\n right cannot repose in the nether world.\n But once what I am bent on, what is\n holy, my poetry is accomplished:\n Be welcome then, stillness of the shadows' world!\n I shall be satisfied though my lyre will not\n accompany me down there. Once I\n lived like the gods, and more is not needed [Kaufmann\n1976].\n\n\n\nH√∂lderlin is saying he doesn't care about quantity at all. If he can\naccomplish something great, if he can ascend to the heights and do\nsomething great with his poetry, that's enough. Once he's lived like\nthe gods, more is not needed.\n\nSo, in thinking about what we want to do with our lives, it's not\nenough to have the kind of theory that we've begun to sketch in\nprevious weeks, where we think about what are the various things worth\nhaving in a life?--we also have to address this question of quality\nversus quantity. Is quality only important insofar as it gets folded\ninto producing greater quantity? Or does quality matter in its own\nright as something that's worth going for, even when it means a smaller\nquantity? And if quality does matter, does quantity matter as well? Or\nis, indeed, quality all that matters? Is H√∂lderlin right when he says\nonce I've lived like the gods, more is not needed?\n\nNow, H√∂lderlin, I imagine, in thinking about why that kind of life\nis the best kind of life he could aspire to, is thinking, in part,\nabout the lasting contribution that his poetry makes. There's a sense\nin which, when we think about having done things like that, we feel\nthat we attain a kind of immortality. We live on through our works. And\nso the next question I want to turn to in thinking about strategies of\nhow to live in light of the fact of, in terms of facing our mortality\nis, well, maybe a kind of immortality is worth going after. Or\nmaybe, at the very least, we can take a kind of comfort in thinking\nthat we have or can attain a kind of immortality. I emphasize the word\n\"kind,\" of course, because strictly speaking, if you live on through\nyour works, it's not as though you are literally living on. It's\nsemi-immortality or quasi-immortality. I suppose people who don't\nbelieve in it would prefer to call it pseudo-immortality. Actually,\nthis reminds me of a joke. Here's a Woody Allen joke. \"I don't want to\nbe immortal through my work; I want to be immortal through not\ndying.\"\n\nWell, as you know, previously I've argued that genuine immortality,\nunending life, would not be a good thing. But still, many of us aspire\nto this kind of semi-immortality. And actually, it can take, I think\nagain, two broad forms. Sometimes people want to say there's a sense in\nwhich, although it's not as though you're literally living on, there's\nsomething like that going on, insofar as a part of you continues. If I\nhave children, then literally some of my--in my case, there's a\nmale--one of my cells continues. And then their cells continue in their\nchildren and their cells continue in their children. If you think of an\namoeba splitting and splitting, and splitting and splitting again, part\nof the original amoeba could be there for many, many, many generations.\nSome people take comfort in the thought that, literally speaking, a\npart of them will continue, if not through cells through my offspring,\nperhaps at least my atoms get recycled, get used again. And so I get\nabsorbed into the universe, but I never disappear. Some people take\ncomfort in that thought.\n\nThe German philosopher Schopenhauer thought that this should reduce\nsomewhat the sting of death. He said, \"But it will be asked, ‚ÄòHow is\nthe permanence of mere dust, of crude matter, to be regarded as a\ncontinuance of our true inner nature?'\" And he answers,\n\nOh! Do you know this dust then? Do you know what it is and\nwhat it can do? Learn to know it before you despise it. This matter,\nnow lying there as dust and ashes, will soon form into crystals when\ndissolved in water. It will shine as metal; it will then emit electric\nsparks‚Ä¶ It will, indeed, of its own accord, form itself into plant and\nanimal; and from its mysterious womb it will develop that life, about\nthe loss of which you in your narrowness of mind are so nervous and\nanxious.\n\n\n\nWell, that's a very moving passage, but I have to say, I don't buy\nit. I don't find any comfort at all in the thought that my atoms will\nstill be around getting reused into something else. So, this first kind\nof semi-immortality, where you take comfort in the thought that\nliterally there are parts of you that will continue, this strikes me as\na kind of desperate striving, desperate reaching for straws. Perhaps in\nSchopenhauer's case, leading him to delude himself into thinking, \"Oh,\nit's not so bad that I'm going to die and going to die soon. At least\nmy atoms will still be around.\" It doesn't work for me.\n\nThere's a second sort of approach, though, where it's not so much\nthat you're supposed to be comforted by the thought that your\nparts will continue to last after you, but that your\naccomplishments will continue to last after you. H√∂lderlin\nwrites poetry, which we're still reading some 200 years later. You can\nwrite a novel which can be read for 20 or 50 or 100 or more years. You\nmight make some contribution to math or philosophy or science, and 50\nor 100 years later, people could still be talking about that\nphilosophical argument or that mathematical result.\n\nYou might have other kinds of accomplishments. You might build a\nbuilding that will last after you. Stone cutters, I've read interviews\nwith stone cutters who take a kind of pride and comfort in the thought\nthat long after they're gone, the buildings that they helped build will\nstill be there. You might try to build a company that will last after\nyou die. Or, for that matter, you might take pleasure and comfort in\nthe accomplishment of having raised a family. Here, not so much the\nthought that some of your cells are in your offspring, but rather the\nthought that to have raised another decent human being is a nontrivial\naccomplishment, something worth having done with your life. And that\naccomplishment continues after you're gone.\n\nWell, what should we think about this second group of approaches to\nattaining semi-immortality? I've got to say that I'm of two minds when\nI think about them. Unlike the dust and the atoms stuff, where I just\nthink you're deluding yourself, I find myself drawn to this second set\nof thoughts. I find myself tempted by the thought that there's\nsomething worth doing about producing something that continues for a\nwhile. That it's significant. And even if my life here on earth is a\nshort one, if something that I've accomplished continues, my life is\nthe better for it. That's H√∂lderlin's thought, I suppose. And it's a\nview that appeals to me. I suppose it explains, in part, why I write\nphilosophy, in the hopes that the things I write might still be read 20\nyears after I die, or 50 years or, if I'm so lucky, 100 years after I\ndie.\n\nWell, in certain moods, perhaps in most moods, I'm drawn by that\nthought. But in other moods, I've got to confess, I'm skeptical of it.\nI remind myself of Schopenhauer writing his little passage, his Ode\nTo Dust, and I find myself saying, just like Schopenhauer was so\ndesperate that he deludes himself into thinking, \"Oh, it doesn't matter\nthat I'm about to turn into dust. Dust is really, really important,\"\nI'm just deluding myself as well, when I think there's something\ngrander, something significant, something valuable about having made an\naccomplishment, having achieved something that continues beyond me. So\nin certain moods, at least, I find myself thinking that I've just\ndeluded myself.\n\nBut that's only certain moods. And at least most of the time, I find\nmyself in agreement with H√∂lderlin. Not necessarily in thinking\nquantity doesn't matter at all. To have written one great work is all\nyou need and more great works doesn't add anything--that strikes me as\ngoing too far. But at least to have done something significant that\nabides, that does seem to me to add to the value and significance of my\nlife.\n\nWell, let me mention an entire different approach. I'm going to give\nvery, very short shrift to this last approach, but it's probably worth\nmentioning as well. The entire assumption of all the lines of thought\nthat I've been discussing so far today have in common the underlying\nbelief that the way to deal with the fact that we live and then we're\ndead is to try to make the life that you've got as good as possible, as\nvaluable as possible, to pack as much into it as you can, even though\nthere's room for disagreement about what's the best strategy for doing\nthat. The picture is one in which we say we can't do anything about the\nloss of life, so the right response is to make the life that we've got\nas valuable as it can be, to see it as valuable as it can be.\n\nBut there's a rather different approach. That alternative approach\nsays, yes, we're going to lose life and that's horrible. But it's only\nhorrible insofar as you think of life as something that it's bad to\nlose. After all, if we were to decide that life wasn't really a\nvaluable gift, if it wasn't really something worth embracing, and\nsomething that we could turn into something full of value, then its\nloss wouldn't actually be a loss. That's a point we've seen before,\nright? The central badness of death is explained in the depravation\naccount. You are deprived of the fact that you could have had more life\nthat would have been worth having overall. But if life isn't worth\nhaving overall, then its loss is not a bad thing, but a good thing. The\ntrick, then, isn't to make life as valuable as it could be, but rather\nto come to recognize that on balance, life isn't positive, but\nnegative.\n\nI know that what I'm about to say has a kind of Classics\nIllustrated simplicity to it, and it's a bit of an\nover-exaggeration, but in gross terms, we might say the first general\noutlook--that life is good and so the loss of it is bad and so the\nanswer is make as much of it as we can while we've got it--you might\nsay that is, in broad strokes, the western outlook. And in broad\nstrokes, the notion that life isn't really as good as we take it to be,\nbut is, in fact, bad overall, perhaps it's oversimplification to call\nit the eastern outlook, but at least it's an outlook that gets more\nexpression typically in eastern thought than in western thought.\n\nForemost example of this second outlook is, I suppose, Buddhism.\nFour noble truths in Buddhism. The first noble truth is that life is\nsuffering. Buddhists believe if you think hard about the underlying\nnature of life, you'll see that everyplace there is loss. There is\nsuffering. There is disease. There is death. There is pain. Sure, there\nare things that we want and, if we're lucky, we get them. But then we\nlose them and that just adds to the suffering and the pain and the\nmisery. On balance, life isn't good. First noble truth, life is\nsuffering. And so, armed with this estimation, what Buddhists try to do\nis to free you from attachment to these goods, so that when you lose\nthem, the loss is minimized. And indeed, Buddhists try to free you from\nwhat they take to be the illusion of there being a self. There is no me\nto lose anything.\n\nDeath is terrifying insofar as I worry about it being the\ndissolution of myself. If there is no self, there's nothing to\ndissolve. It all makes sense--and I have tremendous respect for\nBuddhism--it all makes sense, given the thought that life is suffering.\nBut for better or for worse, I'm a child of the west. I'm a child of\nthe Book of Genesis, where God looks on the world and says, \"It's\ngood.\" For me, at least, the strategy of minimize your loss by viewing\nthe world as negative, is not one that I can be at rest with. For me,\nlife can be good. And so the choices for me, and I suppose for most of\nus, remain among the strategies with which I began. How is it that we\ncan most make our lives valuable? What is it that we can do that will\nallow us, with H√∂lderlin, to say, \"once we lived like the gods\"?\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n---\n\nResources\n\n\"To the Parcae \" by Friedrich Holderlin, translated by Walter\nKaufmann, from Existentialism, Religion and Death by Walter\nKaufmann, copyright (c) 1976 by Walter Kaufmann.

How\ndoes the fact that we will die--how should that affect the way that we\nlive? What we're going to turn to now, our final topic for the\nsemester, is the flip side. The fact of our mortality raises the\nquestion as to whether or not we should put an end to our life.\nStrictly speaking, I suppose it's not the fact that we're mortal, per\nse, it's one of those extra features of death that I've discussed\npreviously, the variability of death. And more particularly still, the\nfact that we can control how long we live. We face the possibility of\nending our life earlier than it would end otherwise. That's suicide, of\ncourse.\n\nAnd so our final topic is, under what circumstances, if any, does\nsuicide make sense? Under what circumstances, if any, is it an\nappropriate thing to do? Now, it's a fairly widespread feature of our\nculture that suicide is looked upon with such a mixture of disdain,\nfear, finding it offensive, that it's very hard, often, to think\nclearly and discuss the topic clearly. Most people think it's either\nthat you've got to be crazy to kill yourself. The very fact that you\nare contemplating suicide is evidence that you're crazy. And if you're\nnot crazy, then it shows that you're immoral. Suicide is clearly never,\nnever right, the right thing to do.\n\nSo, what I want to propose is that we take some time and look at the\nquestions on both sides with a fair bit of care. And the very first\nthing to do, I think, in thinking about the topic of suicide, is to\ndistinguish questions of rationality from questions of morality. That\nis, I want us to take a look at, initially, the question, under what\ncircumstances, if ever, would suicide be the rational thing to do? And\nthen later turn to the question, when, if ever, would suicide be a\nmorally legitimate or a morally permissible or morally acceptable thing\nto do?\n\nIn posing this distinction, I'm obviously presupposing that these\nquestions can come apart, or at least they need to be examined\nseparately. Questions of rationality on the one hand, and questions of\nmorality on the other. These are both questions about oughts, as we\nmight put it. They're evaluative questions. But at least most people\nare inclined to think that we are drawing on different evaluative\nstandards when we raise the one set of questions, as opposed to when we\nraise the other.\n\nIn many cases, no doubt, rationality and morality go hand in hand.\nAnd there are philosophical views about the nature of rationality and\nthe nature of morality, according to which they always go hand in hand.\nBut many of us are inclined to think that they can come apart. Take,\nfor example, given the season of the year that it is, consider doing\nyour income taxes or, more particularly still, cheating on your income\ntaxes. The rate at which income tax forms get audited is very, very\nslight. And so--and the fines tend to not be especially egregious, even\nif you do get caught. So that from a rational point of view, many of us\nmight think it might well be a rational decision to cheat.\nYou're not likely to get caught. Even if you do get caught, how bad's\nthe fine anyway? But even if we were to agree that it was rational to\ncheat, most of us would then immediately want to follow that remark up\nby pointing out that doesn't at all mean that it's morally acceptable\nto cheat on your income tax. There's a case perhaps where you're\nmorally required to do something that you're not rationally required to\ndo.\n\nOr, take a choice from the other point of view. There you are,\ntrying to decide between--there you are, trying to decide between your\nvarious choices of college. And you've gotten into Yale on the one\nhand, and perhaps some crummy school, your second-rate backup school,\non the other. And you're trying to decide what to do there. Well, you\nmight think to yourself, morally I have no obligations here. There's no\nparticular obligation, moral requirement, to go to the better school\nrather than the worse school. But for all that, it would be\nirrational of me, perhaps, to go to the worse school. So there's\na case where there's no moral requirement, but there's a rational\nrequirement.\n\nAgain, we could debate the details of the two examples, but the\npoint's just to show that, in principle at least, on the face of it,\nthese two questions can come apart. Sometimes it's rationally\nacceptable to do something, but it's immoral. Sometimes it's morally\nacceptable to do something, but it's irrational. So in thinking about\nsuicide, we need to pose the two questions, one after the other. So,\nlet's start with the question about the rationality of suicide.\nWhen, if ever, is suicide a rational decision to make?\n\nNow, once again, the first thing I want to do in thinking about the\nrationality of suicide is to distinguish two different issues, or two\ndifferent questions. The first question is going to be this. When, if\never, would it be true that you are better off dead? Could it be the\ncase that your life is going so badly that you'd be better off dead?\nSecond question, assuming that the answer to the first question is,\nunder such and such circumstances, you would be better off dead, we\nstill have to ask, could it ever be rational for you to trust\nyour judgment that this is one of those cases in which you're better\noff dead? Could it ever be rational for you to kill yourself?\nConceivably, the answer to the second might be no.\n\nJude, would you please turn off the camera for a moment? Are you\nready? Okay. [speaking to the cameraman]\n\nAll right. So, the question was this. It's conceivable you might\nhave a thought like the following. In those circumstances in which life\nhas gotten so horrible that you'd be better off dead, you can't think\nclearly. And the very fact that you can't think clearly would entail\nthat you shouldn't trust your judgment that you are in one of those\ncases. Whether that's a good argument or not is something we'll have to\nturn to later. But it's because of the possibility of that argument\nthat I wanted to distinguish the initial question, could it be true\nthat you're better off dead? from the secondary question, even if it\ncould be true that you're better off dead, could it ever be a\nreasonable or rational decision for you to believe that you're in one\nof those situations? Unless we've got the two things in place, it\ndoesn't seem likely that it's ever going to be rational to commit\nsuicide.\n\nSo, the very first topic we have to look at is, could it ever be\ntrue that you'd be better off dead? And immediately, there's a kind of\nlogical worry that may occur to some of you, certainly has been raised\nby various philosophers. And that's to say that the very judgment, the\nvery claim, that Jones would be better off dead can't make any sense.\nOn the assumption that, look, in order to make comparisons--better off,\nworse off; here he is in such and such a situation; he'd be better off\nin that other situation--you've got to be able to talk about, on the\none hand, what condition or state the person is before and what\ncondition or state the person would be in afterwards, if they\nwere to make that choice. Call this the two-state requirement.\n\nNormally, when we make judgments about whether something would leave\nyou better off or worse off, we satisfy the two-state requirement.\nYou're trying to decide whether or not to lose some weight. And you\nthink, well, here's how well off I am now, being overweight. Here's how\nwell off I would be later, if I were to lose that weight. I can compare\nthe two states, say the second state's better than the first state.\nThat's what makes it true that I'd be better off. Trying to decide\nwhether or not to marry the person or break up with the person or pick\nthis career or change careers. You've got the state you're in and you\ncompare it to the state you would be in. You compare the two\nstates. That's what allows us to say, \"Yeah, I'd be better off\" or \"No,\nI'd be worse off.\"\n\nBut when we're talking about cases of suicide, cases where, well,\nhere I am now, the before state requirement's in place, but if\nwe contrast that with the after state requirement, well, that\npart's not met, right? When you--On the assumption that death is the\nend, that you won't exist, nonexistence isn't a state that you\nwill be in. It's not a condition of you, because states and\nconditions presuppose existence. We can talk about are you happy? Are\nyou sad? Are you bored? Are you excited? All of those things presuppose\nyour existence. Even are you sleeping? is a state or condition you can\nbe in, because you exist. But if I kill myself, I won't exist. There is\nno second state to compare. So, how could we possibly say, the\nobjection goes, how could we possibly say that I'd be better off dead?\nThat seems to presuppose that there's a second state that we can\ncompare to my actual state. Since there isn't one, the judgment, I'd be\nbetter off dead, can't even get off the ground. It's got a logical\nmistake built right into it. Well, that's the objection. And, as I say,\nthere are a number of philosophers who are drawn to it. Maybe some of\nyou are drawn to it as well.\n\nIt seems to me that it's mistaken. Consider what we wanted to say\nwhen we talked about the deprivation account, the central account of\nwhat's bad about death. For most of us, dying would be bad, because it\nwould deprive us of the good things in life that we would get, if only\nwe didn't die. That seemed like a natural thing to say. It seemed like\nan appropriate thing to say. Of course, we might ask, if we believe in\nthe two-state requirement, how could we have said that? After\nall, given the two-state requirement, to say that death is bad for me,\nI'd be better off staying alive. If we believe in the two-state\nrequirement, we've got to say, Oh, so had I died, I would have been in\nsome state that I could compare to my current state and say that it's\nworse. But, of course, death isn't a state. So, the two-state\nrequirement's not met.\n\nWell, we might say this should give us some pause. If the two-state\nrequirement--It would be one thing if all that the two-state\nrequirement said was, you know, we can't ever say we'd be better off\ndead. But it turns out the two-state requirement's got more\nimplications than that. It's got the implication that you can't even\nsay you're better off staying alive. And that's very, very hard\nto believe.\n\nImagine that you've got some happy person, some incredibly happy\nperson with a wonderful life filled with whatever goods you think are\nworth having in life--love and accomplishment and knowledge and\nwhatever it is. He's walking across the street and he's about to get\nhit by a truck. And so, at some risk to yourself, you leap into the\nway, pushing him out of the way, saving his life. And happily, you\ndon't get hurt either. He looks up, realizes he was this close from\ndeath and he says, \"Thank you. Thank you for saving my life.\"\n\nAnd now what you have to say is, \"I'm afraid you're rather confused.\nBecause to say ‚Äòthank you' for my saving your life is to presuppose\nI've benefited you in some way. To presuppose I've benefited you in\nsome way is to assume that you're--it's a good thing that your life has\ncontinued. But, you see, given the two-state requirement, we can't say\nit's a good thing that your life continued, because the two-state\nrequirement says we can only make that kind of remark when there's a\nbefore state and an after state. And the after state would have been\nnonexistence. So, you see, you're really rather philosophically\nconfused in thinking that I've done you some sort of favor by saving\nyour life.\"\n\nI can't take that argument seriously. It seems to me that--and I\nhope that none of you would take it seriously, either. Of\ncourse, you are doing somebody a favor when you save their life,\ngiven the assumption that their life has been and would continue to be\nwonderful. And what that shows is not that so nonexistence really is a\nkind of spooky, super thin state or condition. No, of course it isn't.\nNonexistence is nonexistence. It's no kind of condition or state at\nall. What it shows is the two-state requirement isn't a genuine\nrequirement on these sorts of evaluations. We don't have to say that if\nyou had died--when you point to the person whose life you saved, we\ndon't have to say that had you died, you would have been in some\ninferior state. We simply have to say the life you would have had, had\nI saved you and indeed will have, given that I have saved you, is a\ngreat life. Since it's good, to lose it would be bad. Since losing it\nwould be bad, saving it for you is benefiting you. It's doing you a\nfavor. Two-state requirement says otherwise. Two-state requirement's\ngot to go.\n\nBut, having gotten rid of it, we can say the same thing in principle\non the other side. Imagine there was somebody whose life was horrible,\nfull of pain and suffering and misery. Now, whether there could be such\na person, again, that's a question we'll turn to in a second. But if\nthere were such a person, then we can say, for their life to continue\nisn't good for them; it's bad for them. Their life is full of misery\nand suffering and frustration and disappointment. And the more and more\nof that, the worse and worse the life is. To lead a life of 100 years,\nwhere every moment is torture and pain, is worse than a life of 30\nyears, where every moment is torture and pain. So, if you had such a\nperson, for their life to go longer would be bad. In which case, for\ntheir life to be going shorter, would be better for them.\n\nAnd that's all we mean when we say they'd be better off dead. Not\nthat there's some spooky super thin and hard to describe condition that\nthey'd be in if they were dead. But simply, we look back at the two\npossible lives they could have. Just with the person whose life we\nsaved. The first person, we compare the great life that lasts 100 years\nversus the great life that only lasts 20 years because you didn't save\ntheir life. We say, oh, the life of 100 years, better life. And so,\nsaving their life is a good thing for them. Similarly, we compare the\nlives of misery, the long life versus the short life of misery. And we\nsay, oh, the long life of misery is a worse life to have than the short\nlife of misery. And that being the case, we simply can say you'd be\nbetter off dead. Not that you'd be in some condition that's a good one.\nIt's simply, you'd avoid this condition, which is a bad one. And\nif the two-state requirement says otherwise, so much the worse for the\ntwo state requirement.\n\nAll right. So this is by way of the logical worry, that we can't\neven get off the ground in talking about the possibility that you'd be\nbetter off dead. I think if we believe in the two-state requirement,\nmaybe we'd have to say that. But the cost of accepting the two-state\nrequirement is so implausible, that the person's dying of a heart\nattack and you perform CPR. Instead of saying \"Thank you,\" they say,\n\"Oh, I'm really no better off than I would have been if I died, even\nthough I'm having a wonderful life.\" The two-state requirement's just\nso implausible, we should let it go.\n\nNow, having done that, of course, doesn't yet tell us that it could,\nin fact, be the case that somebody's life could be so bad that they'd\nbe better off dead, that the existence that they've got is worse than\nnot existing at all. All we've done so far is leave open the door; open\nthe door to the possibility of saying that coherently. But that doesn't\nmean it's true. Whether or not there could be such lives depends on\nyour view about what's the correct account of well-being. What is it\nthat goes into making somebody's life worthwhile?\n\nNow, as we've seen previously, this is a controversial topic. People\ndisagree about the ingredients of the best kind of life. And because of\nthese differences, we're going to get philosophical differences of\nopinion with regard to whether or not a life could be so bad that it\nwould be better for it to come to an end.\n\nI'm not going to try to rehearse all the possible theories there\nare. Or, for that matter, even all the theories that we've talked about\npreviously. But to give you an illustration of how it could be true,\nimagine, go back to our simplest theory of well-being--hedonism,\naccording to which your quality of life is a matter of adding up all\nthe pleasure and subtracting all the pain. And we need to take into\naccount how long the pleasures and the pains last and how intense the\npleasures and the pains are. But still, we add up the total amount of\npleasure, add up the total amount of pain, subtract the pain from the\npleasure and look to see what our grand total is. If it's positive,\nyour life's worth living. And the greater the number, the greater the\npositive number, the more your life is worth living.\n\nIf it's negative though, if your life is filled with pain and\nsuffering, or at least so much pain and suffering that it outweighs\nwhatever pleasures you may have in your life, so that your balance is a\nnegative one, then your life's not worth living. Having that go longer\nand longer is just more and more negative balance. That's a life that's\nbad for you to have and you'd be better off not having it. You'd be\nbetter off having your life come to an end. You'd be better off dead.\nAnd, of course, the more and more negative the grand total is, the\nworse your life is. And so the more it's true that you'd be better off\ndead. Well, that's what hedonism says.\n\nIf we're not hedonists, and of course, previously I've argued that\nwe shouldn't be hedonists, then we need a more complicated theory of\nthe good. We need to throw in other things, perhaps, certain external\ngoods. It's not just a matter of getting the insides right--the\npleasure and the pain and the other mental states--there are various\nfacts about your objective hookup with the rest of the world. Are you\nreally climbing Mount Everest? Are you really accomplishing things? Do\npeople really love you, and so forth and so on? Whatever your list is\nof those other objective goods--well you'll probably also want to have\na list of other objective bads, besides pain. But still, the same basic\nidea is going to be in place. We're going to want to somehow add up all\nof the various objective goods, add up all the various objective bads,\nand see where the balance lies. Do the goods outweigh the bad? If the\ngoods outweigh the bad, that's great. Your life's worth living. But if\nthe bads outweigh the good, then your life is not worth living, or not\nworth continuing.\n\nNow, as we've noted before, there are philosophical theories which\ngo on to claim--pessimists, various versions of pessimistic views,\nwhich say, for everybody in all circumstances, life is so bad that\nthey'd be better off dead. Life's so full of suffering and misery, that\nwhatever pleasures there are and other goods there may be in the life,\nthey get outweighed by the objective bads. There are philosophical\nviews like that, but I suppose the commonsense view is, well, even if\nsome lives may be so bad that the person is better off dead, that's not\ntrue of all lives. It depends on the facts of the case.\n\nSo, let's focus on that possibility. Of course, even here, we still\nhave to return to another issue that we've considered before. Namely,\nis life itself worth having? Is the very fact that you're alive itself\na good thing? These are the valuable container theories, which I've\npreviously contrasted with the neutral container theories. You'll\nrecall that according to the neutral container theories, in thinking\nabout the quality of someone's life, you just look at the contents.\nLife itself is only a container, good or bad, depending on what it's\nfilled up with. But opposed to the neutral container theories, we had\nvaluable container theories which say the very fact that you're alive\nadds some positive value above and beyond whatever's going on in your\nlife. Now, even the valuable container theories came in different\nversions. There were more modest versions, where in principle, the\npositive value of being alive could be outweighed if the contents got\nbad enough. And we contrast that with fantastic container theories,\naccording to which being alive is so valuable, that it doesn't matter\nhow bad the contents get, the grand total is always a positive one.\n\nNow look, if you accept a fantastic container theory, then pretty\nclearly, it's never true that somebody could be better off dead.\nBecause no matter how bad the contents get, the fact that they're\nalive, per se, is so valuable, it outweighs that subtotal, giving us a\npositive grand total. So pretty clearly, from the perspective of\nfantastic container theories, suicide will never be rational, because\nit's never true that you're better off dead, because it's never true\nthat your life over all, taking everything that's relevant into\nconsideration, gives us a negative. Yeah, question.\n\nStudent: [inaudible]\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: The question was, on the fantastic\ncontainer theories, what's so incredible about life itself? Are we\nsaying it's intrinsically valuable? And yes, the answer is: precisely.\nThe fans of the valuable container theories are saying being alive\nitself is valuable. You may recall that I previously said although\npeople talk that way, they probably don't actually mean it, right? If\nyou told them, okay, you can be alive as a blade of grass, they\nwouldn't say, \"Oh, wouldn't that be wonderful? That's worth having.\"\nMost fans of the claim that being alive, per se, is valuable don't\nreally mean life per se. They mean something more like life as a\nperson. Being the kind of entity who can think and plan, even if your\nplans go wrong, at least you were a person able to experience things,\nknow things, and so forth.\n\nOf course, if that's the reason for accepting the fantastic\ncontainer theory, then we might wonder what should we say about those\ncases where the P-functioning has decayed and the person is no longer\nable to continue as a person, but perhaps can still feel pain? In that\ncase, perhaps, life could cease to be worth living. Though whether or\nnot we should describe it in that way also depends on these complicated\nissues that we've discussed previously, about would that still be you?\nWould you still exist? Would you still be alive under those\ncircumstances? So, the basic idea behind valuable container theories is\nthat life, or the life of a person, or something like that, has\nintrinsic value above and beyond the question of what's going on within\nyour life.\n\nIf we accept the fantastic container theory, maybe nobody's life is\never so bad, grand total. Because--so that suicide would be the\nrational thing to do--because the value of life, per se, is so\nincredible that it outweighs the contents. It has to outweigh\nthe contents. That's a philosophical view at the opposite end of the\npessimists. The pessimist said, \"As a matter of philosophical\nreflection, we can see that everybody's life is worse than nothing.\"\nThe fantastic container fans are saying, \"As a matter of philosophical\nreflection, we can see that everybody's life is better than\nnothing.\"\n\nMost of us, I imagine, find ourselves somewhere in between. Either\nwe believe in the neutral container theory and think it's a contingent\nmatter whether the contents are sufficiently good or bad. Or, we may\naccept the modest version of the valuable container theory. On that\ntheory, of course, life has some intrinsic value, but it's got a finite\nintrinsic value. And in principle, even that could be outweighed\nif the contents get bad enough. And so again, it would be an empirical\nquestion. We have to take a look and see, in which cases do the\ncontents get bad enough?\n\nNow, I guess I'm one of these people in the middle. I'm inclined to\nthink it's not true that everybody's life is worse than nothing. Nor is\nit true that everybody's life is better than nothing. It varies from\nperson to person. And indeed, not just--since we're thinking about\nsuicide, we're not talking about their life as a whole, but really,\nwhat does life promise from here on out? Sadly enough, sad to say, it\nseems to me there are cases, and probably most of us are familiar with\ncases, where the correct description, given the--your favorite theory\nof well-being--is going to be that for this person, here on out,\nwhat life has to offer is sufficiently bad, so that the contents are\nsufficiently negative as to outweigh whatever value life itself might\nhave.\n\nWe could imagine somebody in the terminal stages of some illness,\nwhere their cancer perhaps is causing them a great deal of pain. And\nthe pain is so bad that they can't really do much of anything else.\nIt's not as though they could continue working on their novel or\ncontinue talking with the members of their family, because they're just\ndistracted by the pain and wishing it would come to an end. Horribly\nenough, many degenerative diseases leave the person less and less\ncapable of doing the things that give life value. And the very\nrealization that you're in that situation and no longer able to spend\ntime doing things, or hanging out with your family, or talking with\nthem, or whatever it is may, itself, be a source of more frustration\nand pain.\n\nThere are medical conditions where, horribly enough, infants get\nborn where they're just in continual pain and they never develop\ncognitively. Their brain doesn't develop and then they die. And you\nlook at these lives and you say these are lives--I want to say, these\nare lives that were not worth having. These children would have been\nbetter off never having been born at all, certainly not any kind of\nfavor for them to continue their lives.\n\nWell, let's focus on some case like the terminal patient. A person's\ngot a disease--at least, that would be a nice easy example. Not easy to\nlive through, but easy philosophically. Easy example to think\nabout--some terminally ill patient whose disease is getting worse and\nworse. And so, there are fewer and fewer of the good things in life\nthat the future holds for them. Instead, what the future holds is more\nand more pain, suffering, incapacity, and frustration. When it gets bad\nenough, it seems to me, in some of those cases the person can correctly\nsay, or we, at least, can correctly say of them, they'd be better off\ndead.\n\nAll right. Let me try to draw some examples. Again, we're bracketing\nthe question: Can the person think clearly about their case? That'll\ncome later. Let's just try to talk about when would suicide make sense?\nWhen would it be sort of a rational thing to do to end your life? A\ncouple of different cases. I'm going to draw graphs. We'll let the\nx-axis represent time. And the y-axis represents how good or bad your\nlife is at that time. For those of us who are fans of the neutral\ncontainer theory, the thing to say is this represents the overall\ngoodness of your contents or the overall badness of your contents. The\nhigher up, the better the contents. The lower down, the worse the\ncontents. For those who are fans of the modest container theory, this\nrepresents the grand balance. So it's contents plus the extra bit you\nget from being alive. But of course, if you're a fan of the modest\ncontainer theory, then even if the contents are negative, the grand\nbalance might still be positive. But this represents the overall bottom\nline, whether you accept the neutral container theory or the modest\ncontainer theory.\n\nSo, here's an example of what a life might look like. It's going\nalong pretty well and then things get worse. And things sort of\ndeteriorate. And let's suppose this point represents when you would die\nof natural causes, natural death. [See Figure 24.1] So, towards the\nend, life's not as great as it was when you were young and vigorous and\nhealthy and had all sorts of opportunities and accomplishments. But\nstill, till the very end, it stays positive.\n\nWell, if that's what your lifeline would look like, pretty clearly,\nsuicide doesn't ever make any sense. In particular, you wouldn't want\nto say oh, look, here's the place where I should kill myself, because\nhere is where things start to get worse. Yes, things are beginning to\nget worse, but they never get so bad that you're better off dead. So,\nsuicide wouldn't make any sense at all. For suicide to make sense, it's\ngot to be the case that your life takes a turn for the worse. Not just\nany old turn for the worse, but a turn so much for the worse, that for\nsome chunk of your life, your life is worse than nonexistence, the zero\nline, the x-axis. [See Figure 24.2]\n\nAll right. Imagine that's what's happened. Here you are. You're\nhealthy, you're vigorous, you're accomplishing things, but you've got\nsome degenerative disease that's going to make things worse and worse.\nHere's the period in which it's getting worse. And then after a while,\nyour existence is going to be worse than nothing. Here, we can at least\nbroach the question in an intelligible way. Might suicide make sense?\nSuppose this is the point where the downturn begins. Should you kill\nyourself at that stage? No. Because, after all, even though there's a\ndownturn, things are getting worse, there's still going to be another\nperiod of life, another chunk of whatever it is--year, five years, six\nmonths, whatever it is--where although life isn't as good as it had\nbeen before, it's still better than nothing. Killing yourself at this\nearlier moment is, we might say, premature. It's throwing away a chunk\nof life that would still be worth having. It's not the right thing to\ndo. It doesn't make sense rationally.\n\nWell, if not that moment, what about this moment? Here's the precise\npoint at which your life is becoming worse than nothing. For some\ninitial stretch of that, it won't be very much worse than nothing. But\nstill, overall, it's a negative. Up to that moment, your life was worth\nliving. From that moment on, your life is worse than nothing. If you've\ngot complete control over when to kill yourself, well, that would be\nthe time to do it.\n\nSuppose you don't have complete control. It's straightforward enough\nto say if your life is going to become worse than nothing and you have\ncomplete control over when you kill yourself, it seems pretty plausible\nto say the precise moment at which suicide would become rational would\nbe exactly that moment at which your life became not worth having. But\nyou might not have that kind of control. Suppose that what you've got\nis a degenerative disease that is going to progressively strip you of\nthe ability to control your body. Still, your mind works for a much\nlonger time. And so, for a period of time, you're basically stuck in\nyour hospital bed being fed by somebody else. But perhaps you're able\nto listen to your family talk about things, have books read to you.\nMaybe you can engage in conversation, even though you can't use your\narms and so forth. Your life's still worth living, but the time's going\nto come when your life won't be worth living. And at that point, you'll\nno longer have the ability to kill yourself, because you won't have\ncontrol over your body.\n\nIt raises the question of--I'm sure you can all see at this point,\nthe question of suicide also turns into or comes up against, the\nquestion about euthanasia, mercy killing. Under what circumstances is\nit ever rational to ask somebody else to kill you? Under what\ncircumstances, if ever, is it morally legitimate to kill somebody\nelse?\n\nBut let's continue to focus on the case of suicide. Suppose you live\nin a society which is so unenlightened as to have ruled out euthanasia.\nIn fact, you live in our society. And so, what we don't allow is\nthe possibility of somebody else coming along and killing you when the\ntime comes. So, you know the time is going to come at which you'd be\nbetter off dead. But once you're there, once you're here, it's too\nlate. You can't do it. You won't have the ability to kill yourself, and\nnobody else will be able to do it for you. In that case, killing\nyourself earlier might still make sense.\n\nTake this earlier point, for example. Here, if you kill yourself\nnow, you're throwing away some life that's worth living. But if this is\nthe last moment at which you're going to be able to kill yourself, it\nmight still make sense, rationally. Because your choice is not end it\nhere or end it there. We're assuming you don't have the possibility of\nending it here, at the precise moment at which life became no longer\nworth having. Your choice, instead, is really just this. End it here\nand throw away this whole last bit. Or not end it and then continue\nuntil you die from the disease.\n\nSo, your question is only, what do I think about the value of this\nlast bit? On the whole, it's got a good part and it's god a bad part.\nIs it better to have the good part and the bad part or better to have\nnone of it? And the answer, of course, is well, if the bad part's going\nto continue long enough, it's better to have none of it. The bad\noutweighs the good. So that the rational thing to do would be to decide\nto end your life then, when you still can, rather than condemn yourself\nto the long final stretch of life not worth living.\n\nWell, what if the last time that you could actually control it was\nway back here, for whatever reason it is. Here, you've got access to\nthe means of killing yourself and you won't have access later. Your\nlife's still going to be great for a very long time. And then,\ninevitably, it'll be bad for a period of time. But at least if I've\ndrawn it right, if not, we can shorten this. I suppose death would come\nhere. Here's a case where if you don't kill yourself now, you're\ncondemning yourself to the whole rest of the story. But we might say,\n\"All right. Although, admittedly, the end of the story's going to be\nnegative, the only way to avoid that negative last part is to throw\naway this very long great initial part.\" That doesn't make sense.\nAlthough your life is now still going to be a mixture of good and bad,\nand you wish there were a way to end it here, you don't have that\nchoice. It's throw away the good and the bad, or keep them both.\nAnd in this story, obviously enough, the good is enough to outweigh the\nbad. So, suicide doesn't make sense in that situation.\n\nHere's a rather different way the story might go. Suppose your\nlife's going along really great and it takes a turn for the worse but\nthen is going to get better. So, it ends here with death by natural\ncauses. [See Figure 24.3] Could suicide make sense here? Does it make\nsense to say, \"Look, I'm going to kill myself in order to avoid the\ndownturn\" or indeed, even if the recovery wasn't so long a recovery,\ncould suicide make sense here, because you're about to take this big\ndip down and be condemned to most of the rest of your life being\nsignificantly worse than it was before? No, suicide doesn't make sense\nin this situation. Because even though what you're going to have during\nthis period is a life worse than the life you had before, the life\nyou've got here is still above the x-axis. It's still a life worth\nliving.\n\nThis point, I think, is probably crucial enough that it's worth\ntaking a moment to reflect on. The fact that your life is less good\nthan it had been, less good than indeed maybe all the lives around you\nare having--all the people around you are having lives that are better\nthan yours--still doesn't mean that your life is so bad that you're\nbetter off dead. It's easy to lose sight of that, right? Here we are\nsliding down and all we see is the fact that we're moving down. It's\nnatural to get caught up in the thought \"I'm better off dead,\" but it's\na mistake. You're not better off dead.\n\nThis situation, I suppose, is probably--I always worry when I\nspend--when I end this class talking about suicide, because what's the\nmajor cause of death among teenagers? Well, it's suicide. That's not\nreally so all that surprising, because teenagers are pretty healthy, as\npeople go. And so the--you're either going to get killed by an accident\nor you're going to get killed by doing it to yourself. The kind of\nmistake that I think leads most teenagers into killing themselves is\nsomething like this. They've broken up with their girlfriend. They've\nflunked out of school. They didn't get into medical school or law\nschool or what have you. And they think to themselves, \"Oh, from here\non out, my life's not worth living.\" And the answer is, no, that's\nactually, as an objective matter, probably not the case. Even if your\nlife would be less worth living than you had hoped it would be, it's\nstill better than nothing.\n\nOf course, in the typical case, I suppose what it really looks like\nis this. [See Figure 24.4] Small dip then continues wonderfully. But\nyou lose sight of all the good stuff yet to come while you're in the\nmiddle of the dip. So, although I'm taking time now to talk about the\nquestion, under what circumstances might suicide be a rationally\njustified one? I should hasten to add the remark that I'm fairly\nconfident that for nobody in this class would suicide, in fact, be a\nrational decision. Now, that doesn't mean it couldn't turn out to be a\nrational decision later in your life, but that, very likely,\noverwhelmingly likely, is not one now. Well, a couple other\ncases that I still want to have us consider, but I think that's\nprobably enough for today, so we'll take it up there next time.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct25.html":{"url":"lct25.html","title":"Lecture 25","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 25 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nApril 24, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Last time, we were discussing the\nrationality of suicide. We separated the question of the rationality of\nsuicide from the ethics of suicide or the morality of suicide. We'll be\nturning to the morality of suicide later today. But the first question\nin thinking about the rationality of suicide was whether or not it\ncould actually be the case that somebody would be better off dead.\n\nHaving argued that, at least on what struck me as the more plausible\ntheory is, that was a possibility, we then turned to the question of\nunder what circumstances, more particularly--or perhaps the better way\nto put it, at what point--would it be true that suicide might be\nrational?\" In tackling the question, we were initially bracketing the\nquestion about whether you could ever reasonably or rationally judge\nthat the circumstances actually obtained. We'll turn to that question\nin a few minutes. The question we were focusing on originally was just,\nfrom the objective perspective, as it were, what does the graph need to\nlook like in order for it to be the case that you'd be better off dead\nand suicide would be a rational choice? I drew a variety of different\ngraphs, different lines about your life doing better or worse, and\nnoted for each one of them, at what point, if ever, suicide might be a\nreasonable choice.\n\nI want to draw a couple of more graphs before ending this bit of the\ndiscussion. You'll recall the axes. The x axis represents time. The y\naxis represents how good or bad your life is overall, taking into\naccount the value of being alive, per se, if you accept a valuable\ncontainer theory. The higher the line, the better your life is at that\ntime. The lower the line, the worse your life is at that time. You\nmight say, the easy cases, at least in the philosophical point of view,\nare ones where things get worse. Eventually, your life becomes worse\nthan nothing. You'd be better off dead. And it's going to stay that way\nuntil such time as you might die from natural causes. Dying from\nnatural causes. In a situation like this, killing yourself from here on\nout would make sense, assuming you knew the facts, could trust your\njudgment, and so forth and so on. Some of the issues that we'll come\nback to in a minute. [See Figure 25.1]\n\nAnd indeed, as we saw, there will be even cases in which it might\nmake sense to kill yourself earlier, if this was the last chance at\nwhich you had the ability to kill yourself or not, even though you'd be\ngiving up some life that was worth living, that was the only way to\navoid a much larger chunk of life that was not worth living. So,\nsuicide might still make sense. [See Figure 25.2] On the other hand, if\nthe choice was way back here, although this is--killing yourself early\non would be the only way to avoid the later chunk not worth living, at\nleast if that chunk's small enough--suppose it was like this--you'd say\nit doesn't make sense to kill yourself this early. You'd be throwing\naway too much, even though that's the only way to avoid the bad stuff.\nNow, as I say, that's the easy graph, where you go from a life worth\nliving to a life not worth living and it stays there.\n\nBut suppose instead, we have a situation like this. Here, life\nbecomes worse than nothing for a while, but you recover. You're going\nto return to a life that's worth having. And suppose that after you\nrecover, you'll have a very nice third stage, third act of your life\nbefore you would eventually die of natural causes or natural death.\n[See Figure 25.3] Here, the crucial point to make, of course, is that\neven though for a while your life will be worse than nothing, negative\noverall, it doesn't mean that it makes sense to kill yourself at this\npoint. Because, of course, although it's true that if you do kill\nyourself here, you're avoiding this negative chunk, this bit below the\nx axis, doing that also throws away the very large third act where your\nlife returns to being better than nothing.\n\nSince the choices have neither of these, or both, and the positive\nthird act is great enough to outweigh the negative second act, on\nbalance, it doesn't make sense. But of course--, So even though your\nlife might be worse than nothing for some stretch, suicide wouldn't\nnecessarily be a rational decision. But it's crucial in making that\nargument, that the--what I've been calling the third act. Here's act\none, here's act two, here's act three. It's crucial in making this\nargument is that the third act was sufficiently great, sufficiently\nlong and sufficiently high that it outweighs the bad of the second act.\nAnd although that's true the way I've drawn the graph, we could imagine\nthat it wasn't quite like that. [See Figure 25.4]\n\nSuppose that after the second act, in which your life is not worth\nliving, you will recover and have a third act in which life once again\nis good for you, overall. Still at this point, act three doesn't\noutweigh act two. Although there's a recovery, it's too short and not\nhigh enough to outweigh the bad of act two. And so, under that\ncircumstance, when you ask yourself, let's say at this moment, would\nsuicide here be rational? the answer could well be \"yes.\" Although in\nkilling yourself you've given up act three, which would be good for you\noverall, doing that's the only way to avoid act two, which is bad for\nyou overall, and sufficiently bad to outweigh the good of act three.\nSo, if you've got the choice of suicide here, it might well be\nrational.\n\nNotice however, that the crucial point, again, is when are we\ntalking about the possibility of committing suicide? Committing suicide\nhere might be rational, but not necessarily, indeed not at all, at this\nlater moment. Because at this point, the fact that you've gone\nthrough act two is now history. There's nothing you can do about it.\nYou've had this horrible period of your life and now it's over. Your\nquestion is not, can you avoid act two? It's too late for that. You're\nsimply asking yourself, what do I think about act three? Should I avoid\nact three? And that doesn't make sense. We've stipulated that act three\nis good for you overall. So here, suicide no longer makes sense, even\nthough it would have made sense over here.\n\nThe interesting point is that these possibilities are not mere\ntheoretical possibilities, but actually can happen. There's a famous\ncase of, in the bioethics literature, of somebody who suffered a\nhorrible set of burns over a great deal of their body and had to go\nthrough a period, a very long period, of recovery in which they were\nhospitalized, basically immobilized and in a great deal of pain, while\ntheir nerves regenerated and their skin regrafted and the like. And\nearly on in that period, this person said, although he believed that\nhe'd eventually recover, what he was going to have to go through was so\nhorrible that he wished he were dead. Because of the nature of his\nhospitalization, he wasn't able to kill himself. He asked that he be\nkilled and people refused. He went through a period and sure enough, he\nrecovered.\n\nAnd eventually, he said, \"Yes. Now my life is worth living again.\nAnd of course, since it is worth living, now that I'm able to kill\nmyself, it no longer makes sense for me to kill myself. Because here I\nam,\" as he might put it, \"in act three with a life worth living. But\nfor all that, even though I now have a life worth living, I haven't\nchanged my opinion that it would have been better for me back here\ntoward the beginning of act two for me to have been killed, or for me\nto have died. It remains the case that I wish I had died here, so as to\navoid all the pain and suffering, even though I'm now in a period which\nis better for me, good for me overall.\"\n\nAll right. One other case. This is just repeating a point that\nactually I made very early on. In all of these cases where I've argued\nfor the rationality of suicide, it's because eventually the line has\ndipped below the x axis. The crucial point to remember is, even if your\nsituation deteriorates and indeed doesn't recover, that still doesn't\nmake suicide rational. [See Figure 25.5] The question is not, am I\nworse off than I had been or than I might have been had I not had the\ndecline? The question in thinking about the rationality of suicide is,\nam I so badly off that I'm better off dead? And if your life is a\nsufficiently rich and valuable one, there's a great deal of room for\ngoing down, having a worse life, while still ending up at a life better\nthan nothing. In that case, of course, suicide's not rational at\nall.\n\nStill, it does seem to me that there are cases in which the line\ndoes cut below the x axis and remains there for a sufficiently long\ntime, perhaps remains there forever, so that the person is better off\ndead. And so we might say, from that point of view, if only the person\ncould recognize the facts and know for a certainty that's what their\nline was going to look like, suicide would at certain points be\nrational.\n\nStill, that means we need to turn to the second part of the\nquestion. Somebody who believes suicide cannot be rational might say,\nlook, the whole game is in the phrase I just used. Sure, there are\nsituations in which if only you knew the facts, if only you had a\ncrystal ball and knew for a certainty this is what my life is going to\ngo on from here on out, then suicide would be rational. But of course,\nwe never have a crystal ball. We never have the guarantee that this is\nhow the line's going to go. So, the question we need to turn to now is,\ncould it be rational for you to judge that your situation is one in\nwhich the line's going to go below and stay below, or stay below long\nenough, so that on balance, you'd be better off dead?\n\nLet's suppose that somebody's situation is like that, or at least\nthere can be situations like that. Could it ever be reasonable to judge\nthat your situation is like that? And if so, could it ever then be\nreasonable to act on that judgment and end your life? We're still\nbracketing questions about morality. Here we're still looking at things\nfrom the personal, rational perspective. And once again, what I want to\ndo next is distinguish two questions. I want to distinguish between\nquestions about what should we say if you were thinking clearly versus\nwhat should we say if your thinking is clouded. Again, one might think,\nlook, in the type of cases where suicide might be rationally warranted,\nit's going to be so stressful, that nobody can think clearly in the\nmiddle of that situation. And so even if it were true that you could\nreasonably decide to commit suicide if only you were thinking clearly,\nnobody does think clearly. Let's come back to that worry in a\nmoment.\n\nLet's assume for the moment that you can think clearly about your\nsituation. Perhaps you've got some sort of painful disease, but the\ndisease is not painful constantly. There are periods in which it comes\nto an end, brief periods in which you're able to assess your situation,\nweigh up the facts. Could it ever be rational in that situation to\ndecide to kill yourself? Well, as I say, we don't have a crystal ball.\nIf you did have a crystal ball, if you knew for a certainty that your\nline was so bad that it was below zero and wasn't going to recover,\nperhaps we'd say, yeah, in that case, it would be rational to commit\nsuicide. But we don't have a crystal ball. What should we say then?\n\nThe critics of suicide might come back and say, well look, since you\ndon't have a crystal ball, since you never know for sure that you won't\nrecover, since there's always a possibility of recovery, suicide never\nmakes sense. After all, we all know that there's constant progress in\nmedicine. People are always making breakthroughs and what seems like an\nincurable disease one day may have some sort of cure the next. But if\nyou killed yourself, you've thrown away any chance of getting that\ncure. And even if medical cures don't come around, various diseases\nsometimes simply have miraculous remissions. Somebody might just get\nbetter spontaneously. That's always a possibility. It doesn't happen\nvery often, but it does happen now and then. And again, if you've\nkilled yourself, you've thrown away any chance of recovery.\n\nSo the critics of suicide might say, given that there's a chance,\nhowever small, of recovery, whether through medical progress or just\nsome sort of medical miracle--but of course, if you kill yourself\nthere's no chance of recovery--given that, it doesn't make any sense.\nIt can't make sense rationally to kill yourself. That sort of position\ngets articulated now and again. But I think it's got to be mistaken.\nIt's true that we don't have a crystal ball, and so in deciding whether\nto kill yourself, what you're doing is playing the odds. You're\ngambling. But still, gambling is something we do all the time. Indeed,\nthere is no getting away from the fact that in the suicide case, in the\ncase of some terminally ill patient, or at least somebody who appears\nto be terminally ill, there is no getting away from the fact that\nregardless of what decision he or she makes, they are gambling.\nGambling, playing the odds, just is one of the facts of life about how\nwe have to decide. We have to make our decisions under uncertainty.\n\nNow, suppose somebody says then, look, since we agree that we're\ndeciding under uncertainty, it doesn't make sense to throw away the\nsmall chance of recovery. Then I want to say, that doesn't seem to be\nin keeping with the rules that we would normally use in deciding how to\nface a gamble.\n\nAt the back of this room there are two doors. So let's tell a little\nfantasy, science fiction story about the two doors. After class is\nover, you're going to have to decide which one of these doors to go\nthrough. Let's suppose that if you go through door one, it's virtually\nguaranteed that what will happen is you'll be kidnapped and your\nkidnappers will then torture you for a week, after which perhaps you'll\nbe released. Virtually certain, 90% certain, 99% certain, perhaps 99.9%\ncertain.\n\nThere's a small chance, 1 in 1,000, 1 in 10,000, that you won't be\nkidnapped and tortured. Instead, you'll be whisked away to a wonderful,\ntropical vacation where you'll have a fantastic time for a week. Not\nvery likely, but not impossible, 1 in 1,000; 1 in 10,000, maybe less.\nThat's if you go through door one. Door one has 99.99% chance of a week\nof torture, and a 0.01 or 0.001, whatever it is, percent chance of\nwonderful vacation.\n\nOn the other hand, if you go through door number two, 100% certainty\nthat the following is going to happen. You will immediately fall\nasleep. You'll be in a deep, dreamless state for the week, at which\npoint you'll wake up.\n\nWell, what should you do? What should you pick? It's not quite\ncertainty of being tortured versus certainty of sleeping. If it was\ncertainty of being tortured versus certainty of sleeping, I suppose\nwe'd all agree the thing to do is to go through door number two.\nSleep's nothing positive, but on the other hand, it's nothing negative.\nI suppose if we were going to slap a number on it, we'd give it a zero.\nBut torture is clearly a negative. And if it's a week of torture, it's\na very large negative. So, it's zero versus some huge negative number.\nCertainty versus certainty, what should you pick? We'd all agree, I\npresume, you should pick door number two and pick the dreamless sleep\nfor a week.\n\nNow we remember, but wait a minute, it wasn't certain that\nyou were going to be tortured, it was just very, very, very likely that\nyou were going to be tortured. And imagine if somebody says, oh, you\nmust go for the gold. Go for door number one. Sure, it's\noverwhelming likely that you're going to be tortured. But there's a\nvery small chance that you'll get this wonderful vacation. Whereas, if\nyou pick door number two, you're throwing that chance away. And so, the\nonly rational decision must be to pick door number one, to hold out for\nthat chance, no matter how small of getting that fantastic vacation.\nThat's the only rational decision.\n\nIf anybody were to say that, I'd laugh at them. I'd say look, if you\nwant to talk about, well maybe there's room for choice either way, it\ndepends how great the vacation is, something like that. Yeah, there's\nmaybe room for talk. But if you want to insist that the only\nrational decision must be to hold out for the chance of a wonderful\nvacation, no matter how small the odds--given that if you don't get\nthat wonderful vacation, you're going to be tortured and you could\navoid all that by picking the sleep option--if somebody insisted in the\nface of all that, that the only rational decision is to go through the\ndoor which is likely to be torture and a vanishingly small chance of\nvacation, I'd say they're just wrong. That's not a rationally required\ndecision, given the odds. Yes, question?\n\nStudent: [inaudible]\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Great. So, the question was this. The\npoint was, perhaps I'm cheating in making the example this way, because\ndeath of course, isn't--of course, what you're all supposed to be\nlulled into thinking is that death, choosing death, choosing suicide,\nis sort of like choosing to be asleep, a state of dreamless sleep, but\nsleep nonetheless. And the suggestion then was I'm cheating, because\ndeath is forever. I deliberately framed the example in terms of being\ntortured for a week versus being asleep for a week. And perhaps given\nthat choice, it's clearly rationally acceptable to decide that you'd\nrather pick the sleep for a week option. But death isn't just for a\nweek. If you commit suicide, you're dead forever.\n\nSo, let's change the example. Suppose that--you guys are mostly, I\nsuppose, in the vicinity of 20--s,uppose that if you go through door\nnumber one, there's an overwhelmingly likely chance, 90%, 99%, 99.9%\nchance that you'll be kidnapped and tortured. And the torture will take\nplace and last for another 50, 60, 70 years and then you die. There's a\nslight chance, a 10th of a percent, a 100th of a\npercent that no, no, you won't be tortured for the 50, 60, 70 years,\nbut instead, you'll be brought to this tropical island paradise where\nyou'll have this great time for the next 50 years. But what has\nhappened in 99 out of 100 cases, or 999 out of 1,000 cases, or 9,999\nout of 10,000 cases, is the torture scenario. While the people are\nbeing tortured, they beg for mercy. They beg to be put to death. The\nwish they were dead. It is truly the case that the tortures are so bad\nthat these people are better off dead. Remember, we're assuming that\nyou've got a case where you really will be better off dead unless the\nmiraculous recovery takes place.\n\nAnd so again, we have to ask, in a situation like that where the\nperson says--And similarly of course, if you go through door number\ntwo, you immediately fall asleep, and you stay that way for the next 70\nyears, and then you die while in your coma. The fan of door number one\ncomes along and says the only rational decision is to pick door number\none, where it's overwhelmingly likely that you face 50 years or 60\nyears or 70 years of torture. Because, of course, if you were to pick\ndoor number two, you're throwing away your chance, no matter how small.\nYou're throwing away the only chance you have of the wonderful\nvacation. Well, each of us has to decide for themselves. But when I\nthink about this case, this modified case, I still want to say choosing\ndoor number two could be a perfectly rational decision. It's just not\nright to say the only rational decision is door number one.\n\nAgain, if somebody wanted to take a more modest position and say, it\ndepends on how great the vacation would be, how mild the torture would\nbe, maybe 1% chances versus a 5% chance--there's room for debate about\nwhen might the balance come closer to even so it would be reasonable to\ntake the chance. Yeah, there's room for debate. But if the chances are\nsmall enough and the person insists nonetheless, no matter how small\nthe chances are, it could never be rational to pick door number two, I\ncan only say that doesn't seem to be the way we would normally think\nabout making choices.\n\nAnd of course, at this point, you can see how the argument exactly\ncarries over to suicide. If you kill yourself, you're throwing away\nforever any chance of recovery. And that's important and that's worth\nthinking about. But it's also important to think about what was the\nchance of recovery? How large, or more to the point, just how small?\nAnd how badly off will you be if you don't commit suicide? You guys are\n20, but of course, these sorts of choices also perhaps get faced by\npeople who are considerably older and now in the final stages of some\nprogressive disease. The doctor's told them, perhaps they're 70, that\nthere's no significant chance of recovery. Sometimes it happens, but no\nmore than 1 in 100 or 1 in 1,000. But if you continue alive, you will\nbe in, well, perhaps great pain, perhaps unable to do the various\nthings that give your life meaning and value.\n\nCould it be true that it would never be rational, provided\nthat you're thinking clearly, never rational to say, look, the chances\nof something negative are so overwhelmingly great, that even though\ndeciding for death throws away whatever small chance I've got of\nrecovery, the chance of recovery is so small that on balance, it's\nreasonable to throw that chance away and avoid the overwhelmingly\nlikely possibility that I'll continue in my current state with a life\nnot worth living? It seems that if you're thinking clearly, there\ncould be cases in which suicide would be a rational choice.\n\nBut that still leaves us with the question, well, maybe that's where\nall the work needs to be done. What about this point about thinking\nclearly? Even if we grant, for the sake of argument, that there could\nbe cases in which the person's life is so bad that they actually are\nbetter off dead and they stay that way, even if we grant that, if only\nsomebody were thinking clearly, they would see that that was so likely\nto be the case, that suicide would be a rational or reasonable choice,\nstill isn't it plausible to think that in real life, people can't think\nclearly about their situation when they're in situations like that?\n\nLook, it's one thing for us to be sitting here in this classroom,\nwhere I certainly hope that none of you are in this kind of situation.\nIt's easy for us to be sitting here thinking clearly about it and\nrecognize the philosophical possibility of thinking clearly about a\ncase and realizing that it was a rational decision to end it, end your\nlife. But people who are actually in those situations in point of fact\nare not able to think clearly. Because just think about it. What would\nhave to be true of you for your life to be so bad that suicide might be\na rational choice, that you'd be better off dead? Odds are you've got\nto be in some, indeed more than just some, you've got to be in a great\ndeal of pain. Probably a great deal of physical pain. Beyond that, you\nprobably also need to be incapacitated in a certain large number of\nways, so that perhaps you're bedridden, can't enjoy discussions with\nyour family, can't read poetry, or watch television, or whatever it is.\nA life watching television may not be as fantastic as the life that you\nall are able to have, but it might still be better than nothing.\n\nTo imagine a life so bad, it's going to have to have so much\nphysical disability that the amount of emotional distress is going to\nhave to be so overwhelming, how could anybody think clearly in a\nsituation like that? And then, the argument might go, if you can't\nthink clearly, you can't rationally decide to trust the judgment\nyou might make that you're in a situation where suicide is a reasonable\nchoice. You might make the judgment, but if we ask ourselves, should\nyou trust your opinion? the odds are, so the argument goes, no, you\nshouldn't trust your opinion, precisely because anybody for whom it\nwould be true would have to be so emotionally distressed that\nthey're not able to think clearly. If they're not able to think\nclearly, they can't have a judgment that's trustworthy. If the\njudgment's not trustworthy, you shouldn't trust it. And so, suicide\ncould never turn out to be a rational opinion after all.\n\nWell, that's an interesting argument. It think it's an argument more\nworth taking seriously than some of the other ones, some of the early\nobjections we've had against suicide. But even here, I'm not convinced.\nLet's again try to think of a case not quite like suicide and ask\nourselves, can't there be cases where despite the fact that your\nthinking is clouded, it's still reasonable to trust the decisions that\nyou make within your clouded thinking? Suppose you've got some disease\nthat causes you a great deal of incapacity and a great deal of pain.\nBut as it happens, there's a cure, or at least there's a surgical\nprocedure that can be done, and the surgical procedure is almost always\nsuccessful.\n\nSo, what are the choices? Choice number one, continue in your\ncurrent state. You've got some horrible, painful disease and it won't\nget better unless you have the surgery. If you do have the surgery,\nit's very, very likely that it will get better, 99 cases out of 100 the\nsurgery works, or 99.9 cases out of 100 the surgery works, or 99.99\ncases out of 100 the surgery works. Of course, like all surgery, there\nare risks. Sometimes you put the person under anesthesia and they don't\nwake up. It doesn't happen very often, 1 in 1,000, 1 in 10,000, 1 in\n100,000, whatever it is. There's some chance the surgery won't work and\nyou'll die on the operating table. But it's a very, very small chance,\noverwhelmingly likely the surgery will succeed. And if it does succeed,\nyou'll be recovered. That's option number one.\n\nOption number two, you continue in your current state,\nincapacitated, unable to lead a valuable life, suffering, full of pain.\nWell, that's overwhelmingly likely. 1 in 1,000 cases there's some sort\nof natural cure, maybe 1 in 10,000 cases there's a natural cure. But in\n999 out of 1,000 cases or 9,999 out of 10,000 cases, the disease just\ncontinues until, until you die some years down the road. There's your\nchoice. Should you have the surgery or not?\n\nWell, I suppose what we think is, of course you should have\nthe surgery. You'd be a fool not to have the surgery. It's\noverwhelmingly likely going to cure you. But now we worry. Wait a\nminute. Can you trust that judgment? After all, the condition you are\nin is so stressful, so painful, that you are obviously very emotionally\nworked up. And any judgment that you make that it's a reasonable\ndecision to have this surgery is a judgment you're making while under\nthe cloud of emotional distress. How could you possibly trust that\njudgment? And so you shouldn't trust the judgment, the argument goes.\nAnd so you must never agree to the surgery in this situation.\n\nBut that can't be right. Surely we agree that it could be\nreasonable to trust your judgment in this situation. Now, to be sure,\nthe fact that you are in all of this pain should make you pause, should\nmake you hesitate, should make you think twice, and then think again,\nbefore deciding what to do. But still, if somebody says, since you're\nso worked up, it could never be rational to decide to have the\nsurgery, that just seems to be going too far. It doesn't make sense.\nYou've got to make some kind of decision. Deciding not to have the\nsurgery is still making a kind of decision. And either decision then is\na judgment that you're going to be making while worked up, while\nstressed, while under the cloud of pain and suffering. So think twice.\nThink a third time. Get the opinions of others, perhaps. But still, if\nsomebody says it could never be rational to decide to have the\nsurgery and then act on that decision, they're just wrong.\n\nWell, now let's come back to the suicide case. Same kinds of odds,\njust reversed. If you don't decide to commit suicide, we are imagining\nthat it's overwhelmingly likely you'll continue in suffering. Some\nslight chance that you'll recover, but overwhelmingly likely you'll\ncontinue in suffering. Whereas, if you do kill yourself, it's\noverwhelmingly likely and perhaps even guaranteed, your suffering will\ncome to an end. The only chance that it won't is if you think there's\nsome chance of an afterlife. Well, should we be swayed by the argument\nat this point that since you are suffering, your judgment is cloudy and\nso you should not trust your judgment? Well, that can't be a good\nargument. If it wasn't a good argument in the surgery case, I can't see\nhow it could suddenly become a good argument in the suicide case.\n\nWhat does seem right is, precisely because you're working and\ndeciding under the cloud of emotional stress and pain, that you should\nthink twice, and think a third time, and perhaps think yet again. You\nshould not make this decision in haste. You should discuss it with your\ndoctors. You should discuss it with your loved ones. But if somebody\nsays you could never reasonably trust the judgment that you make while\nin these circumstances, I can only say that doesn't seem like a sound\npiece of advice. That claim doesn't seem right to me.\n\nI conclude, therefore, that as long as we're focused on the question\nof the rationality of suicide, ethics aside, the rationality of suicide\nunder certain circumstances, suicide could be rationally justified. You\ncould have a life that is worse than nothing. You could have good\nreason to believe you were in that situation. You could either be\nthinking clearly about your situation, or even if your judgment is\nclouded and difficult, you could still find the odds sufficiently great\nthat it was reasonable to eventually trust your judgment.\n\nThe rationality of suicide, I think, is secured. But for all that of\ncourse, it could still be immoral. There could be actions that\nare rationally legitimate, but for all that, morally illegitimate. As I\nmentioned previously, there's a big debate in philosophy as to whether\nor not these two things can really come apart or not. Arguably, reason\nactually requires you to obey morality, and so even if something's in\nyour self-interest, perhaps it's not rational to do it, if it's\nimmoral. Interesting question. Let's just bracket that question and\njust focus directly on the question now of morality.\n\nWhat should we say about the morality of suicide? Rationality\naside, what should we say about the morality of suicide? Well, to\nreally do justice to this question, of course, we would need to have an\nentire theory of morality laid down, and unsurprisingly, I don't have\ntime to do that for us, an entire class on introduction to ethics where\nwe try to lay down a basic fundamental theory about morality. All we've\ngot left is a couple of minutes today and then one more lecture. So\ninstead, what I want to do is first mention some quick and dirty\narguments that have a kind of moral tinge to them. And then turn to\nsome somewhat more systematic arguments where I'll quickly put in place\nsome basic elements of a plausible moral theory. We won't have time to\nexplore them in detail, but at least we'll get a shape of a basic moral\ntheory and see what it might say about suicide. So, systematic a little\nbit later, first some quick and dirty arguments.\n\nWhether we should call it a moral argument, the first one, or not,\nI'm not quite certain. But it's certainly an argument that gets stated\nall the time in this area. When we think about the legitimacy of\nsuicide, it's common enough to have the reaction, suicide is\nillegitimate because it's thwarting God's will. Maybe this isn't so\nmuch a moral argument as a theological argument. And for the most part,\nof course, as you know in this class, I've avoided at least some\ntheological questions. Obviously, questions about the existence of a\nsoul is itself a theological argument. But I've tried to discuss them\nas far as possible without bringing in questions about God, God's\nexistence and God's will. But the topic's almost unavoidable when we\nthink about suicide, given the prevalence of the thought, it's God's\nwill that we stay alive and so it's going against God's will to kill\nourselves.\n\nWell, I think the best response to this argument was given by David\nHume some several centuries ago, two and a half centuries ago, where\nHume says, look, if all we've got to go on is just the idea of a\nCreator who has built us and given us life, we can't infer that suicide\nis against God's will. At least, if you've found that thought a\ncompelling one, then why wouldn't you also find it compelling to say it\ngoes against God's will when you save somebody's life? This is a\npoint that's close to one I've raised before. You're walking along\nChapel Street and the person you're talking to, you see, is about to be\nhit by a car. So you push them out of the way. Previously, when we\ntalked about this question, the question was whether or not they should\nbe grateful to you. Now the question is whether or not they should\ncomplain, \"How dare you do that! You've thwarted God's will. It was\nGod's will that I be hit by that truck.\"\n\nSo, when we're about to save somebody's life, should we decide not\nto do that on the grounds that it must be God's will that they're going\nto die? If you're a doctor and somebody's in cardiac arrest and you\ncould now perform CPR, or whatever it is, in order to get their heart\ngoing again, should we say as a doctor, \"Oh no, I must not do that.\nIt's God's will that they die. If I try to save their life, I'm\nthwarting God's will.\" Well, nobody says that. But then, why is the\nargument any better in the case of suicide?\n\nWe could of course imagine, when you've saved your friend's life and\nhe says, \"Oh, you thwarted God's will,\" what you might come back and\nsay is, \"Oh, no, no. You see, it was God's will that I save your life.\nAnd so it was God's will that you be in the situation where the truck\nwas going to hit you unless I saved you. But it was also God's will\nthat I save your life.\" And maybe the doctor should say something\nsimilar. Not an implausible thing to say. But given that that's not an\nimplausible thing to say, why not say the same thing about suicide? It\nwas God's will that I be in this situation, and then God's will that I\nkill myself. Absent any special instruction manual from God, the God's\nwill argument cuts both ways, which is to say it doesn't give us any\nguidance. We don't know whether it's God's will that we act, or God's\nwill that we don't act, absent an instruction manual from God. So, we\ncan't conclude that suicide is obviously wrong, because it violates\nGod's will. Well, unless you've got an instruction manual.\n\nYou might think, for example, that the Bible tells us not to commit\nsuicide. And since the Bible is God's word, we must do whatever the\nBible tells us. That's a kind of argument that I'm perfectly prepared\nto engage in. Although, of course, there's a lot of assumptions behind\nthat argument that we would need to really examine. Is there a\nGod?--Well, obviously we needed that weighing in for the God's will\nargument.--Has God expressed his will in a book? If so, what book is\nit? Do we have moral reason to obey God? Also relevant for the God's\nwill argument. And of course, if we do think we have an obligation to\nobey this instruction manual, are we really prepared to obey this\ninstruction manual?\n\nEven if there's a sentence in this instruction manual that says\ndon't commit suicide, a lot of other things the instruction manual also\nsays that most of us are not inclined to do. The instruction manual\nsays not to eat pork. Well, how many of you are not willing to eat\npork? The instruction manual tells you not to mix various kinds of\nmaterial together in a single item of clothing. How many of you think\nthat that's unacceptable? The instruction manual tells you that if a\nteenager is rude to their parents, they should be stoned to death. How\nmany of you think that that's a moral requirement? If you're going to\npick and choose which bits of the instruction manual you actually think\nare morally relevant, then you can't come to me and say, \"Oh, suicide\nis wrong because the instruction manual says so.\" You're not really\nusing the instruction manual to give you moral guidance. You're\nstarting with your moral beliefs and then picking and choosing which\nbits of the instruction manual you want to accept. Well, that's a big\nquestion. That's a big topic. And so having just touched on it, I'm\ngoing to have to put it aside. Instruction manual aside, at the very\nleast, we might say, appeal to God's will can't help us to decide\nwhether or not suicide is legitimate or not.\n\nBut there's a different quick and dirty argument. Also it can be run\nin a theological form, but it need not be run that way. And that has to\ndo with gratitude. We've been given life and life's pretty amazing. And\nso we have an obligation, a debt of gratitude to keep the gift.\n\nNow look, gratitude is not one of the moral virtues that gets a lot\nof discussion nowadays. It's fallen on rather hard times. But I see no\nreason to dismiss it. It does seem to me there is such a thing as a\ndebt of gratitude. If someone does you a favor, you owe them something.\nYou owe them a debt of gratitude.\n\nAnd so the argument might then go, look, either God gave us life, or\nnature gave us life, or our parents gave us life. Whatever it was, we\nowe a debt of gratitude for this wonderful gift. And as such, how do\nyou repay the debt? You repay the debt by keeping the gift. If\nyou kill yourself, you're rejecting the gift. That's being ungrateful,\nand ingratitude is immoral. It's wrong. And that's why suicide is\nwrong. That's the second quick and dirty argument.\n\nPerhaps it won't surprise you that I don't find this second argument\npersuasive either. Not because I'm skeptical about debts of gratitude,\nbut I want us to pay attention to what exactly obligations of gratitude\nrequire us to do. In particular, it's important to bear in mind that\nyou owe the person who gives you a gift something only when what he's\ngiving you, or she's giving you, is a gift. Imagine that\nsomebody, I'll call him The Bully, gives you a pie and says, \"Eat it.\"\nBut it's not an apple pie. It's not a cherry pie. It's some gross,\ndisgusting, slime pie, some rotting slime pie, and he cuts out a big\npiece and he says, \"Eat it.\" Do you owe this person, as a debt of\ngratitude, out of gratitude, do you owe him the obligation to eat the\npie and continue eating the pie? That would seem like a rather odd\nthing to claim. This guy is indeed, as I've named him, just a\nbully.\n\nNow, of course, typical bullies, at least in the comic book cases,\nbullies are big and strong. The bully might be able to say the\nfollowing thing to you. \"You eat this pie or I will beat you up. I'll\nbeat the crap out of you.\" And look, I'm not a very strong guy. He\nmight well be able to do it, and I might not, I might well know he is\ngoing to do it. And so, it might be prudent for me to eat the\nslime pie, disgusting, appalling as it may be. It might be better to\nhave a couple of slices of slime pie than to be beaten up to a pulp.\nBut there's no moral obligation here. There's no moral requirement to\neat the pie.\n\nWell, if God takes on the role of bully and says, \"Eat the pie or\nI'll send you to hell,\" maybe it would be prudent of you to do what he\nsays. And if God takes on the role of bully and says, \"Even though your\nlife has become so horrible that you'd be better off dead, I insist\nthat you keep living or I'll send you to hell if you kill yourself,\"\nmaybe it's prudent of you not to kill yourself. But there's no moral\nrequirement here. God's just a bully on this story.\n\nNow, that's not to say that I think God is a bully. If you believe,\nplausibly enough, God is good, then God's not going to want you to\ncontinue eating the pie once it's spoiled. He gives you an apple pie.\nHe says, \"Eat it. It's good for you. You'll like it.\" Out of gratitude,\nyou eat it. But then God, not being a bully, says, \"If the pie ever\nspoils, you can stop eating.\" Why in the world would he insist that we\ncontinue to eat a spoiled pie if He's not a bully? So, I can't see how\nany argument from gratitude is going to get off the ground. If there's\nsomething immoral about suicide, we're not going to get the immorality\nthrough these quick and dirty arguments. We're going to have to get it\nfrom some more systematic appeal to moral theory. And that's what we'll\nturn to next time.\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"},"lct26.html":{"url":"lct26.html","title":"Lecture 26","keywords":"","body":"\nDeath: Lecture 26 Transcript\n\n\n\n\nApril 26, 2007\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Shelly Kagan: Last time we turned to questions\nabout the morality of suicide, and I started with two arguments that I\ncalled quick and dirty arguments. I suppose it would have been fairer\nto say that they were really theological arguments, or they were moral\narguments that used, in part, theological premises. I suggested that,\nat least if we look at them in their quick and dirty versions, they\nwere inadequate, and if we're going to make a more careful argument\nabout the morality of suicide, we need to turn to a more systematic\nview about the contents of morality. We need to look at suicide in\nterms of the basic moral principles. Now, that's not something we've\ngot the chance to do in detail, but I think we can at least say enough\nabout a couple of basic approaches to the contents of morality, or the\nbasic moral rules, to get the beginnings of an understanding of what\nmight emerge about the morality of suicide if we were to do that more\ncarefully.\n\nSo, holding off on suicide for the moment, let's ask ourselves, what\nis it that makes an action morally acceptable or morally forbidden?\nThis is, unsurprisingly, something that different moral theories\ndisagree about. But there's at least one factor or one feature that\nall, or almost all, moral theories agree about. And that is that the\nconsequences of your action matter. That is, we might or might not\nthink that consequences are the only things that are morally\nrelevant when we think about the morality of your action, but surely it\nis one thing that's morally relevant--what are the consequences\nof your action going to be.\n\nSo, let's think about the morality of suicide with an eye towards\nconsequences, bearing in mind that since we're talking about a moral\npoint of view we need to take into account the consequences as they\naffect everybody. Now, the person who, of course, is most affected by\nsuicide is, of course, the person who is killing themself. And at first\nglance it might seem pretty clear that the consequences of suicide are\nbad for that person. After all, the person was alive and now they're\ndead, and we normally would take death to be a bad result.\n\nIf I were to tell you, \"Oh, here's a switch on the wall. If you were\nto flip the switch, a thousand people who would otherwise be alive\nwould end up dead,\" you would normally take that to be a pretty\ncompelling argument against flipping the switch. Why? Because the\nresult would be bad. Why? Because a thousand people would end up\ndead.\n\nWell, one person ending up dead isn't as bad as a thousand people\nending up dead, but for all that shouldn't we still say it's a bad\nconsequence? And as a result of that, shouldn't we say that however far\nappeal to consequences goes in terms of giving us our moral theory,\ndon't we have to say in terms of consequences, or with regard to\nconsequences, suicide is immoral?\n\nBut not so quick! Even though it's true that normally death is a bad\nthing, it's not always a bad thing. This is the sort of thing that\nwe've learned by thinking about what does the badness of death consist\nin. Typical cases are ones in which the person's dying robs them of a\nchunk of life that would've been good for them overall, and because of\nthat dying then is bad for them. But in the kinds of cases that we're\nthinking about, cases where suicide would be rationally acceptable, and\nwe're now asking whether or not it's morally acceptable--in those sorts\nof cases, at least the kind of paradigm examples that we've been\nfocused on, the person is better off dead. They're better off dead,\nmeaning that what life now holds out for them--although perhaps not\nnegative through and through--is negative on balance. It's negative on\nbalance; they're not better off continuing to live. They're better off\ndying. And that means, of course, that dying isn't bad for them, but\nrather good for them, and so their death is not a bad consequence, but\nrather a good consequence.\n\nProvided that you're prepared to accept the possibility of cases in\nwhich somebody would be better off if their life ended sooner rather\nthan later, we're led to the conclusion that--from the moral point of\nview as far as focusing on consequences goes--the consequences might\nactually be good rather than bad if the person were to kill themself.\nThey will free themself, let's suppose, of the suffering they would\notherwise have to undergo. Well, that's--first glance said,\nconsequences says suicide's wrong. Second glance says, consequences\nsays, as least in certain circumstances, suicide's right. Of course,\nthird glance suggests, we can't just focus on consequences for the\nperson who is contemplating suicide. Because from the point of view of\nmorality we have to look at the consequences for everybody.\n\nWho else might get affected by the death or suicide of the person?\nWell, the most obvious people for us to think about at that point then\nare the family and loved ones--the people who most directly know about\nand care about the person who is contemplating suicide. And again--I'm\nrunning out of glances, but at first glance you might say, well, there\nthe consequences are clearly bad. When the person kills themself that\ncauses, typically, a great deal of distress for the family and friends\nof the person who has killed themself.\n\nEven if that's true, we now have to ask, how do the consequences\nweigh out? After all, we live in a world in which no single act\ntypically has only good consequences, or no single act has bad\nconsequences and only bad consequences. Often our choices are mixed\npackages where we have to ask whether the good that we can do is\ngreater than the bad that we'd be doing with this act or that act or\nsome third act.\n\nEven if there are, then, negative consequences in terms of distress\nto the family, friends, and loved ones, of the person who kills\nthemself, that might still be outweighed by the benefit to the person\nhimself or herself, if it was really the case that he or she would be\nbetter off dying.\n\nBut it's also worth bearing in mind that insofar as we're thinking\nabout people who love and care about the person who is considering\ndying, then they may actually overall, on balance, be relieved that the\nsuffering of their loved one has come to an end. We will, of course,\nall be horribly distressed that nature, or the Fates, or what have you,\nhas brought it about that this person's choices are now reduced to\nkilling themself on the one hand, or continuing the terminal stages of\nsome illness where they're incapacitated and in pain. We will, of\ncourse, wish there was a serious prospect of a cure, some chance of\nrecovery, wish they'd never gotten ill in the first place.\n\nBut given the limited choices, continued suffering and pain, on the\none hand, or having an end to that suffering and pain, if the person\ncan rationally assess their prospects and reasonably come to believe\nthey're better off dead, then that's a judgment their loved ones can\ncome to share as well. They may well regret the fact--more than regret,\ncurse the fact--that these are the only choices they've got, but\nstill, given the limited choices they may agree, they may come to\nagree, better to put an end to the suffering. And so when the person\nkills themself, they may second that choice. They may say, \"At least\nthey're not in pain and agony anymore.\"\n\nSo, if we look at it from the point of view of consequences--in\nfact, suppose we had a moral view that said consequences aren't just\none thing that was morally relevant in thinking about what makes an\naction right or wrong. Suppose we took the bold claim that consequences\nare the only thing that's morally relevant. There are moral views that\ntake this position. I suppose the best-known example of this kind of\nconsequence-only approach to morality is utilitarianism. Utilitarianism\nis the moral doctrine that says right and wrong is a matter of\nproducing as much happiness for everybody as possible, counting\neverybody's happiness equally. And when you can't produce happiness,\nthen at least trying to minimize the misery and suffering, counting\neverybody's misery and suffering equally.\n\nSo, suppose we accept this utilitarian position. What conclusions\nwould we come to then about the morality of suicide? I suppose the\nconclusion would be a kind of moderate one. On the one hand, we'd be\nrejecting the extreme that says suicide is never morally acceptable,\nbecause to say that, you'd have to be claiming suicide always has bad\nconsequences overall. And that strikes me, although it's an empirical\nclaim, it strikes me as a rather implausible empirical claim. It's,\nsadly enough, not too difficult to describe cases in which the results\nmay actually be better if the person kills themself rather than having\ntheir suffering continue. It may be better for them and better for\ntheir family.\n\nOn the other hand, we certainly wouldn't want--if we were\nutilitarians--we also wouldn't want to go to the other extreme and say\nsuicide is always morally acceptable, because, of course, to say that\nit's always morally acceptable is to say that the consequences are\nnever bad when you kill yourself. And that's also pretty obviously an\nimplausible thing to claim. You guys are young, you're healthy, you've\ngot a great future in front of you. If you were to kill yourself, the\nresults wouldn't be good. The results would be worse overall than if\nyou had refrained from killing yourself.\n\nSo, the utilitarian position is in the middle. It doesn't say\nsuicide's never acceptable, doesn't say suicide is always acceptable.\nIt says, perhaps unsurprisingly, it's sometimes acceptable; it depends\non the facts. It depends on the results. It depends on comparing the\nresults of this action, killing yourself, to the alternatives open to\nyou. We have to ask, is your life worse than nothing? Is there some\nmedical procedure available to you that would cure you? If there is,\nand even if your life is worse than nothing, that still doesn't make it\nthe best choice in terms of the consequences. Getting medical help is a\npreferable choice in terms of the consequences.\n\nWe can even think of cases where your life is worse than nothing,\nyou'd be better off dead, and there is no medical alternative of a cure\navailable to you, but for all that, it still isn't morally\nlegitimate to kill yourself in terms of the utilitarian outlook.\nBecause, as always, we have to think about the consequences for others.\nAnd there may be others who'd be so adversely affected by your death\nthat the harm to them outweighs the cost to you of keeping yourself\nalive. Suppose, for example, that you're the single parent of young\nchildren. You've got a kind of moral obligation to look after them. If\nyou were to die, they'd really have it horribly. It's conceivable then,\nin cases like that, the suffering of your children, were you to kill\nyourself, would outweigh the suffering that you'd have to undergo were\nyou to keep yourself alive for the sake of your children. So, it all\ndepends on the facts.\n\nStill, if we accept the utilitarian position, we do end up with a\nmoderate conclusion. In certain circumstances suicide will be morally\njustified--roughly speaking, in those cases where you're better off\ndead and the effects on others aren't so great as to outweigh that.\nThose will be the paradigm cases in which suicide makes sense or is\nlegitimate, morally speaking, from the utilitarian perspective.\n\nBut of course, that doesn't mean that suicide is indeed ever morally\nlegitimate. Because we don't necessarily want to embrace the\nutilitarian theory of morality. Utilitarianism is what you get, roughly\nspeaking, when we say consequences matter and they're all that\nmatters. But most of us are inclined to think that there's more to\nmorality than consequences. Most of us are inclined to think that there\nare cases in which actions can have bad results--rather, actions can\nhave good results and yet, for all that, be morally forbidden. Or\nactions could have bad results and yet, for all that, still be morally\nrequired. That's not to say that consequences don't matter morally;\nit's to claim, rather, that consequences aren't the only thing\nthat matters morally. Consequences can be outweighed by other morally\nrelevant factors. Well, that's the position that's held by the branch\nof moral theory known as deontology.\n\nSo deontologists say other things matter morally besides\nconsequences. In deciding whether your action is right or wrong, you\nhave to pay attention to the consequences, but you have to pay\nattention to other things as well. What other things? Well,\nunsurprisingly, this is an area then in which different deontologists\nwill disagree one to the next in terms of what else they want to add to\nthe list of morally relevant factors. But there's one kind of\nadditional factor that most of us in our deontological moods would want\nto add to the list, and that's this--so one, at any rate, that's\nrelevant I think, most directly relevant for thinking about suicide.\nThat factor is the factor of not just what was the upshot of your\naction but how you produced that upshot; not just what the\nresults were, but what was your means of getting those results\nand more particularly still, did you have to harm anybody to\nproduce the results?\n\nMost of us are inclined to think it's wrong to harm people, or at\nleast innocent people. It's wrong to harm innocent people even if the\nresults of doing that might be good. Now, I threw in the qualification\nabout innocent people because, of course, it's also true that most of\nus are inclined to think that self-defense might be justified. Harming\npeople who are attacking you or your friends or your fellow\ncountrymen--that may be legitimate. And so it's not as though we want\nto say it's never legitimate to harm somebody. But those people are\nguilty; they're aggressors. What most of us in our deontological moods\nare inclined to think is it's never legitimate to harm an\ninnocent person. And the crucial point is that's true even if\nthe results would be better.\n\nLook, there's no debate between deontologists and utilitarians about\nharming innocent people in the normal case, because normally of\ncourse--you know, suppose I, to make an example--to end the class with\na nice big bang, right--I brought my Uzi sub-machine gun. I now take it\nand go rat-a-tat-tat, killing 15 of you. Well, that would not be\nsomething that would have good results. And so, clearly, the\nutilitarian is going to reject that as well as the deontologist.\nThey're in agreement about that. In the typical case, killing an\ninnocent person has bad results, harms them. It's wrong, full stop,\nwe're done.\n\nBut what should we say about cases where killing an innocent person\nhas better results? In real life, it's hard to think of cases like\nthat, but we can at least go \"science-fictiony\" and tell an example.\nSo, here is one of my favorite examples in moral philosophy.\n\nSuppose that we have five patients in a hospital who are going to\ndie because of organ failures of one sort or another. One of them needs\na heart transplant, one of them needs a kidney transplant, one of them\nneeds a liver transplant, and so forth and so on. Unfortunately,\nbecause of tissue incompatibilities, even as they begin to die we can't\nuse the organs from the ones that have died to save the others.\nMeanwhile, here in the hospital for a routine check-up is John. John's\nperfectly healthy. And as you're doing your exams on him you discover\nthat he's exactly suitable to be an organ donor for all five of the\npatients. And it occurs to you that if you were to find some way to\nkill him, but cover up the cause of death so it looked like he died of\nsome unexpected freak seizure, you could then use his organs to save\nthe five. This one gets the kidney, that one gets the other kidney,\nthat one gets the heart, that one gets the liver, and that one gets the\nlungs. So your choice, roughly, is this. Just give John his routine\nmedical exam, in which case the five other patients die, or chop up\nJohn, kill him and chop him up, using his organs to save the five\npatients.\n\nWell, what should we say is the right thing to do the organ\ntransplant case? In terms of consequences it looks as though, if we\ntell the story right at least, the results would be better if we chop\nup John. After all, it's one versus five. And although the death of\nJohn is a horrible bad result, the death of the five is a horrible bad\nresult. And so the results would be better if we were to kill innocent\nJohn.\n\nWell, if we had more time we could argue about are the results\nreally going to be better, is that a realistic story--what have\nyou--are there other long-term effects on the healthcare profession\nthat we haven't taken into account? But we don't have time to really\npursue this story in detail. Let's just suppose we could eventually get\nthe details right; the results really would be better if we chopped up\nJohn. Is that the right thing to do?\n\nWell, maybe utilitarianism says it's the right thing to do, but it's\nprecisely for that reason that most of us would then say, you know,\nthere's more to morality than what utilitarianism says. Now, whether\nthat objection is a good one is a very, very complicated question, and\nif you want--if you'd like to pursue it--if you want to pursue it--then\nI invite you to take an introductory class in moral philosophy. For our\npurposes, let's just suppose that most of us are on board with the\ndeontologists when they say there's more to morality than what the\nutilitarian has, and this example brings it out. It's wrong to kill\nsomebody who is innocent even though by hypothesis the results would be\nbetter--it's five to one. People have a right to life, a right not to\nbe killed. And that right weighs in when we're deciding what to do\nmorally, so that it's wrong to kill an innocent person even if the\nresults really would be better.\n\nAll right, let's suppose we agree with that--accept that. Again, in\na fuller class on moral philosophy we'd have to ask ourselves what is\nthe basis of that right, what other deontological rights do people\nhave, what exactly are the contours of that right? But here we can just\nask, suppose we accept a right like that, what are the implications of\nthat for the morality of suicide? And now, it seems what we have to say\nis, suicide is wrong. Suicide is morally unacceptable. Because when I\nkill myself, well, I'm killing somebody. And didn't we just say as\ndeontologists that killing an innocent person--and I'm an innocent\nperson--killing an innocent person is morally wrong? Well, I'm a\nperson. So, killing me is morally wrong.\n\nAnd it's not really any help to come back and say, but look, we've\nstipulated that this is a case where the person is better off dead. The\nresults will really be better overall if he kills himself. Yeah, that's\nright. Maybe that is right. It doesn't matter--because as deontologists\nwe said the right to life is so powerful it outweighs consequences.\nJust as it was wrong to chop up John, even though the results would be\nbetter--five versus one--it's wrong to kill yourself, even if\nthe results would be better. Even if that's the only way to put\nyourself out of pain, and those are good results, it doesn't matter.\nThe right to life outweighs the appeal to consequences. So as\ndeontologists, it seems, we have to say suicide is forbidden--full\nstop.\n\nWell, as usual in philosophy, it's not quite as simple as that. One\npossible response somebody might make is, but look, morality is only\nabout how I treat others. It's not about how I treat myself. And if we\nwere to accept that claim, then we could say the right to life only\ncovers how I treat others. In particular, it rules out my killing other\npeople even when the results would be good. But it doesn't have any\nimplications for how I treat myself. And in particular then, if the\nright to life doesn't exclude self-killing, well then, suicide is\nacceptable.\n\nThat's a possible moral view, but I find it rather implausible. If\nwe were to start to explain what it is about you that explains\nwhy it's wrong for me to kill you, we'd start saying things about how,\nwell, you're a person and, as such, you've got all these plans and so\nforth and so on. And as a person, you've got certain rights, certain\nthings that shouldn't be done to you. You're not just, --This is the\nthought that lies behind much deontological thinking, right? People\naren't objects. We can't just destroy them for the sake of better\nresults. Well, that's right; people aren't objects. But of course, I'm\na person too. And so when I contemplate killing myself, I'm\ncontemplating destroying a person. So, it's at least difficult to see\nwhy we would accept the claim that morality only governs how I treat\nother people. It seems--although the issue is a complicated one, which\nwe don't have time to pursue further today--it seems to me more\nplausible to say morality includes rules not only governing how I treat\nothers but also how I treat myself.\n\nYet, if that's right, and if among the moral rules are a right to\nlife, a prohibition against harming people, then don't we have to say,\nlook, it's wrong from the deontological perspective to kill yourself.\nWell, of course, the natural response to this line of thought is to\nsay, but look, when I kill myself--unlike the case of chopping up John\nto save five others--when I kill myself, I'm doing it for my own\nsake. I'm harming myself for my own sake. That seems highly\nrelevant in thinking about the morality of suicide.\n\nIt does seem relevant, though it's not 100 % clear what to do with\nthat thought. Here are two possible interpretations of that thought.\nFirst of all, you might think that the relevance of saying that I'm\nharming myself for my own sake is this. If I'm harming myself for my\nown sake, what I'm saying is, despite the fact that I'm harming myself,\nI'm better off. After all, we stipulated that we were focusing on cases\nin which suicide was rational. So, the person is better off dead. If\nthey're better off dead, then although it's certainly true that there's\na sense in which they're harming themself--I mean killing yourself is\ndoing harm to yourself--still it's not harm overall. The bottom\nline, we were imagining, is positive when you kill yourself. And so,\nalthough, unlike the case of John where you've harmed him and benefited\nothers--so you have harmed him overall--in the case of suicide, when I\nharm myself to avoid the suffering I would otherwise go through, I'm\nnot really, as we might say, harming myself overall.\n\nSo, perhaps the deontological prohibition against harm is really a\nprohibition against harming people overall. Look, you've got\nsome sort of a disease in your--infection in your leg that has now\nspread and it's going to kill you unless we amputate your leg. So, you\ngo into surgery and the surgeon chops off your leg. Has he done\nsomething immoral? It doesn't seem as though he has. But after all, he\nchopped off your leg! He harmed you! You used to have a leg and now you\ndon't have one. Well, what we want to say is he didn't harm you\noverall. He harmed you in such a way that it was the only way to leave\nyou better off bottom line, and that's not a violation of the rule\nagainst harming. At least, that's a possible thing to say. And if\nthat's the right thing to say, then maybe that's what we should say\nabout the suicide case yet again. Yeah, there's a deontological\nprohibition against harming innocent people, but what it's really a\nprohibition against, is leaving them worse off overall. And when I kill\nmyself, I'm not leaving myself worse off overall. And if that's right,\nthen even from the deontological perspective suicide may be morally\nlegitimate. Well, that's at least one possible way to carry out the\ndeontological stand, one possible way of interpreting the remark, \"But\nlook, when I kill myself, I'm doing it for my own benefit.\"\n\nHere's another possible way of interpreting that thought. When I\nkill myself, given that I'm doing it for my own benefit, I've obviously\ngot my own agreement. I can't kill myself against my will.\nSuicide is something you do to yourself. And so, I have my own consent\nto what I'm doing. That seems pretty important. Notice how different it\nis from the case of John. When I chopped up John, I imagine I don't\nhave John's approval. Consent seems to be present in the case of\nsuicide but not in the case of chopping up John. Maybe that's morally\nrelevant as well. Now, to accept that view is, of course, to say we\nneed to add yet another factor into our deontological theory. We have\nconsequences, we have harm doing, but we also have the factor of\nconsent. And so we need to think about the moral relevance of\nhaving the consent of the victim. And once we start thinking about\nthat, I think most of us would be inclined to accept the conclusion\nthat consent can make it acceptable to do to someone what would\nnormally be wrong in the absence of their consent.\n\nBy the by, you'll notice that that seems to be one of the things\nthat's relevant in thinking about the surgery case, not the organ\ntransplant case but the performing the amputation of the leg, to save\nthe person who would otherwise die. Surely it seems relevant that the\npatient has given you permission to operate on them.\n\nHere's another example that shows you the relevance of consent. It\nwould not be okay--it would not be morally acceptable for me to go up\nand hit you in the nose. Just like it wouldn't be okay for you to go up\nand hit me in the face or the gut. And yet, boxing matches are, I\nsuppose, morally acceptable. Why is that? Because from a deontological\nperspective the answer is, when people are boxing they've agreed to it.\nI give you permission to hit me, or at least to try to hit me, in\nexchange for your giving me permission to hit you, or at least to try\nto hit you. And it's the presence of that consent that makes it\npermissible for you to harm me, assuming that you're a better boxer\nthan I am, which I'm confident would have to be the case.\n\nSo, consent makes it legitimate to harm people, even though in the\nabsence of consent it wouldn't be legitimate. All right, if that's\nright, then bring that thought home to thinking about the case of\nsuicide. Suicide might be wrong, because after all I'm a person, at\nfirst glance. But since I'm killing myself, I've given myself\npermission. I've given myself consent to harm myself. And if consent\nmakes it permissible to do what would normally be forbidden, then\nconsent makes it permissible for me to kill myself. And so, now we're\nled again to the conclusion that from a more fully developed\ndeontological perspective we ought to say suicide is permissible, at\nleast if we're prepared to throw in this kind of factor of consent and\nthink that it can just wipe out the protections that would otherwise\nnormally be in place.\n\nIndeed, if we think that, we're going to be led to a rather bold and\nextreme conclusion about the morality of suicide. The person has killed\nhimself, so he's clearly consented, and so in every case what\nhe's done is acceptable. Well, maybe that's right--if we're prepared to\ngo that far with the principle of consent. But maybe we shouldn't go\nthat far with the principle of consent.\n\nSuppose we're talking after class and you say to me, \"Shelly, you've\ngot my permission to kill me.\" And so I get out my gun and I shoot you\nto death. It doesn't seem morally acceptable, even though you gave me\nyour permission, especially--Think of even weirder cases. Suppose that\nyou are feeling like you want to killed because you're overcome with\nguilt because you believe you killed John Smith. But you're crazy. You\ndidn't kill John Smith. John Smith's not even dead. But in your\ninsanity you think you did do it, and so you say, \"Shelly, please kill\nme.\" And I know that you're insane, but hey, you know, consent's\nconsent, and so I kill you. Well, that clearly isn't acceptable. Or\nsuppose you're playing with your three-year-old nephew. He says, \"Oh\nyeah, I don't really like being alive. Kill me.\" Well, that clearly\ndoesn't make it acceptable to kill him or her--well, nephew, it's a\nhim.\n\nSo, if we start accepting this consent principle, we're led to some\npretty implausible conclusions. So, maybe we should throw it out. Maybe\nwe should say, no, consent really doesn't have the kind of power that a\nminute ago it looked like it did. But I'm inclined to think we\nshouldn't go that far and throw away the consent principle altogether.\nBecause if we do throw out the consent principle, we're going to find\nourselves unable to say some things that I think it's pretty important\nto us to say.\n\nConsider the following example. Suppose that we're in war and we're\nin the foxhole and a hand grenade has been thrown into the foxhole. And\nunless something happens quick, the hand grenade is going to blow up\nand it will kill my five buddies who are near the hand grenade.\nUnfortunately, because they're playing cards or whatever, they don't\nsee it. But I see it. But I don't have time to warn them. By the\ntime I tell them what's going on, they won't have time to react.\nReally, it's do nothing, let them get killed but I probably won't be\nhurt very much, or throw myself on the hand grenade, my body absorbs\nthe blow, saves my buddies, kills me.\n\nImagine what happens is that I throw myself on the hand grenade.\nI've sacrificed myself for them. I've done something amazing. Few of us\nwould have it within ourselves to do this, but amazingly enough some\npeople do. And we admire and praise these people. They've\ncommitted--they've undertaken an incredible act of heroic\nself-sacrifice--morally commendable, above and beyond the call of duty\nwe want to say, praiseworthy. But wait a minute, how could it be\npraiseworthy? The person threw himself on a hand grenade, knowing the\nresult of this was that he was going to die. And so he killed a person,\nthereby, apparently, violating the deontological right not to have\ninnocent people be killed.\n\nDon't talk about \"the results are better.\" Yeah, of course, five\nbuddies saved; the results are better. But that doesn't seem enough to\nuse in our deontological moods. After all, suppose that I see the hand\ngrenade, and so what I do is I take Jones and throw him on the grenade.\nWell, that's not okay, even though the results are the same.\n\nWhat makes the difference? Why is it morally legitimate for Jones to\nthrow himself on the grenade? The only answer that I can see is,\nbecause he agrees to it. He did it to himself; he volunteered, it has\nhis consent. If we throw away the consent principle, we're forced to\nsay what Jones did isn't morally admirable. It's morally appalling,\nit's morally forbidden. I can't believe that.\n\nSo, we need a consent principle. But on the other hand, we don't\nwant to go with such a strong consent principle that we say, oh, it's\nokay to kill crazy people, or kill children, just because they say,\n\"Oh, kill me.\" So we need something--a more moderate form of the\nconsent principle. We need to say consent can do its thing, but only\nunder certain conditions. What exactly are the relevant conditions?\nWell, this is, of course, one more topic open for debate. We might\ninsist that, look, the permission has got to be given freely. It's got\nto be given knowing what the upshots are going to be. It's got to be\ngiven by somebody who is sane, who is rational, who is competent,\nwho's--and that may deal with the child case as well, who is not yet\ncompetent to make this sort of decision. There's room for disagreement\nabout what exactly are the relevant conditions to put into a proper\nversion of the consent principle.\n\nWe might also want to throw in some requirement that the person have\ngood reasons for his giving you permission. That might deal with the\ncase where you just come up to me after class and say, \"Kill me.\" I\nmean you're not insane. Well, at least you might not be insane. You\nknow what's going to happen. In some sense, you've reached the age of\ncompetence, but you don't have any good reasons for it. Maybe that's\nenough to undermine the force of consent.\n\nWell, suppose we've got some kind of modified consent principle.\nWhat should we say about suicide then? Well, it seems to me what we're\nled to is, once again, a modest view about suicide. The mere fact that\nthe person killed themself won't show that it was morally legitimate\nbecause, of course, even though they've given themself permission, they\nmay not have had, for example, good reason, or they might be insane.\nBut for all that, if we can have cases--and I take it we can\nhave cases--where somebody rationally assesses their situation, sees\nthat they're better off dead, thinks the case through, doesn't rush\ninto it, makes an informed and voluntary decision, with good reason\nbehind it--in a situation like that it seems to me the consent\nprinciple might well come into play, in which case consent will trump\nor nullify the force of the deontological prohibition against harming\ninnocent people. So, suicide will again be acceptable in some cases,\nthough not in all.\n\nAnd that's the conclusion that seems to me to be the right one,\nwhether we accept the utilitarian position or one of these\ndeontological positions. Suicide isn't always legitimate, but it's\nsometimes legitimate.\n\nIt still leaves the question, what should we do when we see, when we\ncome across, somebody trying to kill themself?\" And there I think there\nis good reason to ask yourself, are you confident that the person has\nsatisfied the conditions on the consent principle? Perhaps we should\nerr on the side of caution, and assume that the person may be acting\nunder distress, not thinking clearly, not informed, not altogether\ncompetent, not acting for good reasons. But to accept that is not to\naccept the stronger conclusion that we must never permit somebody to\nkill themself. If we become convinced that they have thought it\nthrough, that they do have good reason, that they are informed, that\nthey are acting voluntarily, in some such cases it may be legitimate\nfor them to kill themself, and for us to let them.\n\nAll right, almost out of time. So, let me shift gears for the very\nlast time, and take a quick look at where we've been. At the start of\nthe semester, I invited you to think hard about the nature of death or\nthe facts about life and death. Most of us try very hard to not think\nhard about death. It seems to be an unpleasant topic, and we put it out\nof our mind. We don't think about it, even when there's a sense in\nwhich it's staring us in the face. Every single class of this semester,\nevery single day of this semester, you've come into this building and\nhave walked past a cemetery right across the street. How many times did\nyou notice it? How many times did you stop to think about the complete\nvisual reminder that we are on this Earth for a while, and then we're\nnot anymore? Most of us just don't think about it.\n\nWell, of course you are, in some sense, the exceptions. You've spent\na semester thinking about it, and I'll be largely content if you've\ntaken the opportunity this semester to take a hard look at the things\nyou believe. Whether or not you ended up agreeing with me, about the\nvarious claims that I've put forward, is less important than that\nyou've taken the chance to take a hard look at your beliefs and asked\nyourself not just what you hoped or wished or kind of believed was\ntrue, but what you could actually defend. Still, having said that, it\nwould be disingenuous of me to pretend that I don't also hope that\nyou've come around--if you didn't start out believing what I\nbelieve--that you've come around to believing what I believe.\n\nAs I pointed out on the first day, most people accept a great deal\nof this package of beliefs about the nature of life and death,\nthat--They believe we have a soul, that there's something more to us\nthan our bodies. And they believe that because they think, given the\nexistence of a soul, we'll have the possibility of living forever.\nImmortality is a possibility, and we all hope for and crave the\npossibility that we will live forever because death is, and must be,\nhorrible. It's so horrible that we try not to think about it. It's so\nhorrible that when we do think about it we're filled with dread, terror\nand fear. And it's just obvious that that's the only sensible reaction\nto the facts about life and death. Life is so incredible that under no\ncircumstances could it ever make sense to be glad that it had come to\nan end. Immortality would be desirable; suicide could never be a\nreasonable response.\n\nOver the course of this semester, I've argued that that package of\nbeliefs, common as it may be, is mistaken, virtually from start to\nfinish. There is no soul, we are just machines. We're not just any old\nmachine; we are amazing machines. We are machines capable of\nloving, capable of dreaming, capable of being creative, capable of\nmaking plans and sharing them with others. We are people. But we're\njust machines anyway. And when the machine breaks, that's the end.\nDeath is not some big mystery which we can't get our heads around.\nDeath is in some sense no more mysterious than the fact that your lamp\ncan break, or your computer can break, or any other machine will\neventually fail.\n\nI never meant to claim that it's not regrettable that we die the way\nwe do. As I argued when talking about immortality, better still would\nbe if only we had the prospect of living as long as life still had\nsomething left to offer us. As long as life would be good overall,\ndeath is bad, and I think for most of us death comes too soon. But\nhaving said that, it doesn't follow that immortality would be a good\nthing. On the contrary, immortality would be a bad thing.\n\nThe reaction that makes sense in thinking about the facts of death\nis not to find it as some great mystery too dreadful to think about,\ntoo overwhelming. But rather, fear, far from being the rationally\nappropriate response I think, is an inappropriate response.\nAlthough we can be sad that we die too soon, that perhaps should be\nbalanced by the fact of--the recognition of--just how incredibly lucky\nwe all are to have been alive at all.\n\nYet, at the same time, recognizing that sense of luck and being\nfortunate doesn't mean that we're always lucky to be remaining alive.\nFor some of us the time will come in which that's no longer true, and\nwhen that happens life is not something to be held onto, come what may,\nunder any and all circumstances. The time could come for some of us in\nwhich it's time to let go.\n\nWhat I then invited you to do, over the course of the semester, is\nnot only to think for yourself about the facts of life and death, but I\ninvite you all to come to face death without fear and without illusion.\nThanks very much [applause].\n\n[end of transcript]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nback to top\n\n\n"}}}
